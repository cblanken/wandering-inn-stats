        {% include "patterns/atoms/link/link.html" with text="The Wandering Inn" href="https://wanderinginn.com/" external=True %}

        when searching TWI for references and identifying errors in the
        {% include "patterns/atoms/link/link.html" with text="Wiki" href="https://wiki.wanderinginn.com" external=True %}.
