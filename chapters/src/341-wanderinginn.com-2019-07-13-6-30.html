	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Springtime in Liscor was disgusting. True, the initial rains had passed. And the muddy Floodplains were drying. A few valleys were still mudpits where the most stubborn amphibians and fish still clung to life, but the rest of the hills and valleys were now soil. And greenery.</p>
<p>The flowers were blooming. Little shoots of grass were poking up, the various species of grass—crab grass, bent grass, centipede grass, fescues, zoysias, Sage’s Grass, and more, all fighting for a war of supremacy over prime real estate. Some of it was lovely, lush grass that anyone would want to walk through barefoot. Other types would punish the bared sole, or even the improperly maintained boot. But that wasn’t what was disgusting.</p>
<p>The disgusting things were the wildlife. Nature was in bloom, and accordingly, nature was ready to reproduce. And unlike the Rock Crabs which conducted their clandestine affairs in secret under the water and laid deep, hidden caches of their eggs, the rest of the natural world was reproducing fast. Especially the spiders.</p>
<p>Of the many varieties of dangerous spiders in the world, the Shield Spiders were a problem for Liscor. For Izril in general, but Liscor in particular. Shield Spiders weren’t as aggressive as Spear Spiders, but they laid vast nests. Traps they used to ensnare victims.</p>
<p>And Shield Spiders laid a <em>lot</em> of eggs. And in the springtime, they hatched. The average Shield Spider could lay a few hundred eggs in a single egg sac. Larger, older spiders could lay thousands. And they didn’t stop at one egg sac.</p>
<p>The nests writhed with hundreds of thousands of baby spiders, crawling over each other. Eating each other. Covering their parents. Scuttling. And they descended on anything that fell into the nests. Corusdeer, rabbits, errant travellers…the spiders tore into flesh, crawled into openings, invaded organs, and already, began to reproduce again.</p>
<p>Monsters. And there were enough Shield Spider lairs to mean that their springtime reproduction might fully overrun the Flood Plains. Unless something was done.</p>
<p>In the closest Shield Spider lair, built not just two miles south of Liscor’s walls was a burgeoning nest. The walls were coated with sticky silk. And the ground above was cunningly concealed by a thin layer to look like grass. If anything heavier than a rat stepped on it, the artificial terrain would give way and drop it into the nest. And the hungry spiderlings were already devouring a Fortress Beaver that had fallen in.</p>
<p>Now the thin veil of spiderweb parted again. Sunlight shone into the nest as something <em>big</em> hit the ground. The adult Shield Spiders, some the size of wolves and growing ever larger, scuttled forwards, ready to tear the prey apart. But the intruder had landed on his feet.</p>
<p>“1<sup>st</sup> Squad!”</p>
<p>The Gnoll roared as he lifted the mace. He brought it down and smashed the first Shield Spider’s head in. The second met a boot to the pincers and reeled back. The other Shield Spiders, sensing the threat, scuttled forwards. But more shapes were breaking through the firmament above.</p>
<p>Soil and grass cascaded down as Drakes and Gnolls leapt down. Five Gnolls and three Drakes hit the ground. One stomped a Shield Spider into the earth. They swung as they landed, cutting others, bashing them into the ground. Above, seven more members of 1<sup>st</sup> Squad waited. Captain Wikir bashed in another Shield Spider’s abdomen with one contemptuous strike. He turned, stomped a smaller, raccoon-sized one into the ground and tore a finger-sized one as it climbed up his armor. He snarled.</p>
<p>“Kill the adults. Torches!”</p>
<p>The nest was still wet with morning dew. But webs were flammable. And as the 1<sup>st</sup> Squad cut down the biggest spiders and stomped, the smaller ones fled. Some crawled up the [Soldiers], biting frantically, but they were ignored or swatted. Torches came down and the unhatched egg sacks, the walls of the nest went up. Captain Wikir climbed out of the pit, shaking off tiny Shield Spiders and growling in disgust.</p>
<p>“One down.”</p>
<p>Sergeant Gna helped her Captain out of the pit. Wikir accepted her paw and saw eight tiny Shield Spiders scuttle from his paw onto her fur. Gna grimaced, but pulled him out before flicking the spiders out of her fur. Wikir cursed, began to shake himself, and decided against.</p>
<p>“Damn. Get clear, the rest of you. I’m shaking these things off.”</p>
<p>“Watch out that they don’t get in your ears. Or nose.”</p>
<p>Sergeant Gna watched, amused, as Wikir stomped back to the pit and shook himself. It was burning. And the [Mage] attached to their squad was adding to the flames with controlled bursts of magic. The female Gnoll raised her voice as the rest of the [Soldiers] who’d gone down to do the fighting tried to divest themselves of the tiny spiders in the same way.</p>
<p>“You could have let us set fire from above, Captain.”</p>
<p>“And let Pielt call me a coward?”</p>
<p>Wikir looked back. The oldest [Captain] in 4<sup>th</sup> Company grinned, baring his teeth in a predator’s grin. He gestured to the pit.</p>
<p>“I went in. And if I have to pick these little things out of my fur all day, it’s fine. <em>His</em> squad gets to do these all by hand and torch. The rest of these we burn from above, just as planned. The big Shield Spiders come to us.”</p>
<p>“Efficient.”</p>
<p>The younger Gnoll grinned as well. So did 1<sup>st</sup> Squad. They looked around and saw more squads of 4<sup>th</sup> Company doing what they’d done. Hunting down Shield Spider nests and destroying them. And they weren’t the only ones; the Floodplains had a lot of people covering it today. Drakes and Gnolls, nearly a thousand in total.</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> Company was helping with what was a tradition for Liscor’s City Watch. Culling the Shield Spider numbers before they could grow to a plague. It was a gesture of goodwill—and in practice, a good way to get on both the City Watch and Liscor’s good side. And that was important, especially today.</p>
<p>“Hope Watch Captain Zevara appreciates the work.”</p>
<p>Sergeant Gna remarked as she found a fine-toothed comb and approached her Captain. It was standard-issue; thorns and insect eggs were the least of what could get into a Gnoll’s fur. He grunted his thanks and let Gna comb his hair around his armor from behind. He was already working on one arm.</p>
<p>“Damn Pielt and his bets. 1<sup>st</sup> Squad! Keep moving! Find those nests! And don’t fall in; the last thing I want is wasted healing potions or broken bones! Get a move on—or do you want 3<sup>rd</sup> Squad to enjoy a night at Wishdrink’s?”</p>
<p>“<em>No sir!</em>”</p>
<p>The female and male [Soldiers] got back to work with alacrity. Their tools were simple—long sticks to check the ground for telltale pits. They moved fast. This was a contest. Wing Commander Embria had promised a night of fun at one of the best taverns in the city, Wishdrink’s, for whomever got the most nests.</p>
<p>Speaking of which…Gna and Wikir glanced left. They saw Wing Commander Embria, mounted on her warhorse, watching her company work. She wasn’t taking part, but she was hardly slouching on the job; her posture was military straight. Gna grinned.</p>
<p>“There’s our Wing Commander. And that’s why she’s a Wing Commander, eh, Captain? She’s not jumping into nests.”</p>
<p>“It. Was. A. Bet.”</p>
<p>Wikir bit out. He sighed and put away his comb, then stomped the mud and growing grass to kill the spiders he’d just toss off him.</p>
<p>“That’ll do. But we’re all getting checked and a visit to the bathhouses. The last thing I need is for one of those little things to lay eggs in your ear.”</p>
<p>“They do that?”</p>
<p>“Hah. When <em>I</em> was a rookie, I heard about someone who got a bunch of these worm eggs in his head. Began acting weirdly. And then the swelling started. By the time they hatched out of the head, they were was large as…”</p>
<p>The [Captain] was grinning, regaling his subordinate with a tale as his company searched for another nest. 2<sup>nd</sup> Squad, led by Captain Vell, was already on their third. A particularly large Shield Spider met a cluster of spears that sunk halfway into the thick, hard shell, until Captain Vell herself cut off a leg and the [Soldiers] took it apart from a distance. 4<sup>th</sup> Company was efficient.</p>
<p>The City Watch was slower, owing to lower levels and less motivation. But everyone was at work. The city was watching. The people of Liscor had taken to the walls to watch the annual spring culling with urbane amusement. And it was all going well. Embria cut a fine figure on her horse, her spear at the ready in case a giant Shield Spider emerged. Her crimson scales were a flash of color on the dull landscape of colors. And 4<sup>th</sup> Company was working hard, brave [Soldiers] aiding in the safety of their city.</p>
<p>“Hear that cheering?”</p>
<p>Captain Wikir grinned at his Wing Commander as she rode slowly down a hill towards them. Embria smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“Good sounds, aren’t they? Keep it up, Wikir. Nice show.”</p>
<p>“Anything for the city, Wing Commander. And these elections.”</p>
<p>Wikir flicked at his fur. Embria nodded. She scratched the spines on the back of her head. The cheering was indeed coming from the city, and it was a surprise, but one that made both her and Wikir smile with pleasure. The army seldom received accolades when it returned home, but that was understandable. There were often issues. But a smaller group, say, 4<sup>th</sup> Company? It seemed they’d finally won the trust of the city. They’d only had to fight in a siege to do it.</p>
<p>“We’re making good progress. Three nests for 3<sup>rd</sup> Company already. Don’t fall behind.”</p>
<p>“We won’t. And we’ll toast to you at Wishdrink’s tonight.”</p>
<p>Wikir grinned. Embria eyed him.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that. You have night duty again tonight. Three days of break after that. I’ll be—er, having a dinner.”</p>
<p>“With Sergeant—no, Senior Guardsman Relc?”</p>
<p>Embria hesitated. She nodded casually, looking past Wikir at the teams working down the Floodplains.</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll thought carefully, watching his squad blasting another pit with flames. Sergeant Gna kicked a Shield Spider into the pit.</p>
<p>“Not from me, or my squad, Wing Commander. There was <em>some</em> talk when he appeared for morning practice. But you can’t fault the fact that he’s the only one better than you on the courts. And it’s not like its private ground; the Adventurer’s Guild is anyone’s territory. So…”</p>
<p>Embria nodded.</p>
<p>“Just let me know if there’s real complaints. Lieutenant Kesa can run her mouth.”</p>
<p>“Will do. And it helps that Senior Guardsman Relc appeared early. Beat half the trainees to be up.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged Gnoll caught the smile on Embria’s lips before she schooled her face. But he liked the pleased look he’d seen. It had been too long.</p>
<p>“That’s my d—uh, Senior Guardsman Relc. He may have quit, but you never forget. Punctual as always.”</p>
<p>That didn’t actually sound like the Relc that Wikir knew. But he kept his mouth shut. The cheering picked up from the walls of the city. He half-turned to look, trying not to show Embria <em>his</em> wagging tail.</p>
<p>“Looks like the civilians really like seeing Shield Spiders getting taken out.”</p>
<p>Embria nodded, very pleased. She looked back towards the city.</p>
<p>“Everyone enjoys a bit of action, Wikir. Especially exterminating monsters. Why don’t we have the [Captains] and [Lieutenants] use some flashier Skills? We can—what’s <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>Wikir’s head turned. For a second he didn’t spot what Embria was looking at. Then his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Reinforcements? Wait—no—”</p>
<p>The Gnoll [Captain]’s curse was an echo of the oath that Embria shouted. The 4<sup>th</sup> Company and nearby City Watch [Guards] looked up. And they saw what Liscor’s citizens had already spotted from their walls. They turned.</p>
<p>It was a pounding in the ground that heralded them. As fast as a racing heartbeat. And there they came, out of the city gates, five abreast. Their shells gleaming. They ran forwards, accompanied by cheers from above. And their colors glowed in the morning light.</p>
<p>There they went. On the other side of the city, over the muddy hills, trampling newly growing grass shoots underfoot. Then, stopping. Pausing, to stare at the grass. At new life poking upwards, frantically growing. Staring at little insects and worms busily surviving in the mud. A passing bird. And of course, the sky.</p>
<p>Three hundred. Far fewer than the City Watch deployed en masse, and far larger than the 4<sup>th</sup> Company of Liscor. But the Soldiers were an army unto themselves. They poured into the Floodplains and up the first hill, an unstoppable wave. Not just regular Soldiers either; they all bore markings on their carapaces, on their bodies. Each one was unique, each one individual.</p>
<p><em>The Painted Soldiers. </em>But that wasn’t what chilled Embria’s blood in her veins. It was the figure leading them. A giant among the Soldiers. Like the rest, his carapace was marked by color. But he stood out again. Because his body bore no paint. The yellow splatters of color splashed across his chest, arms, legs, even his neck stood out. He led them.</p>
<p><em>Yellow Splatters.</em> The [Sergeant] stood out even from the other Soldiers. He led them at a charge up the next hill; the Antinium sprinted after him. They didn’t pace themselves; they just ran, their footfalls thundering in unison.</p>
<p>Ahead of them, the City Watch was moving back. They’d identified dozens of Shield Spider nests, but, Embria noticed only now, hadn’t actually begun destroying any of them. She watched, with equal parts loathing and apprehension as the Antinium ran to the unearthed pits, spreading out. Forming squads. Like her own.</p>
<p>The Painted Soldiers moved precisely, adopting squads, spreading out with an efficiency that put the 4<sup>th</sup> Company of Liscor’s army to shame. It was a connection facilitated by their Queen, by their nature. Soldiers were no True Antinium, but bereft of language, they had a connection that bordered on instinct. They could read body language, and like one multi-bodied organism, they could react to threats within moments, without needing vocal command.</p>
<p>And yet, the Painted Soldiers paused as they reached the first line of Shield Spider nests. And they turned their heads and bodies, looking up. At him, Yellow Splatters. And the [Sergeant] knew they were waiting for his order. So he raised one arm.</p>
<p>He did not have to open his mandibles. He could have nodded, or just tilted his head a fraction of a centimeter. The Soldiers could have known what to do in a hundred more efficient ways. But he stood straighter. And the Soldiers below him looked, waiting. They wanted to hear him say it. Because he <em>could. </em>So Yellow Splatters pointed. And his voice was quiet, but they heard it in their minds, bodies, and souls.</p>
<p>“Forwards.”</p>
<p>It was one command. But it triggered an avalanche. The Painted Soldiers poured forwards. They charged and Embria saw the first, a Soldier with white-blue paint covering his shell like snow, <em>leap</em>. He crashed into the first Shield Spider pit, and Embria saw a Shield Spider go flying <em>out</em> of the pit a second later.</p>
<p>More Soldiers crashed into the pits after the first. They fought in brutal symphony, crushing, breaking, tearing apart the spiders with their four arms and legs. And before Embria could blink, the first Soldiers were already climbing out of the first pit, their bodies stained with Shield Spider blood.</p>
<p>“Dead gods.”</p>
<p>Wikir breathed, his face slightly pale under his fur. Embria’s voice snapped as she turned to him.</p>
<p>“Get ahold of yourself, Wikir. They’re aiding in the cleanup too. Get your squads moving! All of 4<sup>th</sup> Company,<em> stop slacking off! </em>Do you want the damn Antinium to show you up!?”</p>
<p>Her voice roused the 4<sup>th</sup> Company. They set back to work with a will. But the Painted Soldiers were moving even faster. If Embria’s [Soldiers] were running, the Painted Soldiers were sprinting. One with pink stripes reached down and <em>ripped</em> a Shield Spider’s head off his body. Another lifted a spider as large as he was up, capturing four of the eight legs and another mercilessly pounded the spider’s exposed belly until it burst.</p>
<p>Embria had seen Antinium fight. She had killed them. But even she was taken aback by the ferocity of this group. She watched them destroy another nest in less than a minute. Then her eyes travelled to the logical source of this oddity.</p>
<p><em>Him</em>. Yellow Splatters had paused on a hill, arms folded like Embria. But he leapt into motion as she watched.</p>
<p>A giant Shield Spider, a mother, a matriarch as large as two wagons had taken objection to the slaughter of her kin. She unearthed herself, clambering after a group of [Guards] that fled her and a swarm of her kin. The angry giant Shield Spider crawled after them. Embria swore.</p>
<p>“2<sup>nd</sup> Squad, with me! Captain Vell—”</p>
<p>She charged her horse down the hill, her spear ready. But she was too slow. The Antinium were already on the move. A squad of eighteen Painted Soldiers rammed <em>into</em> the Shield Spiders, scattering them like pins. The giant Shield Spider <em>screeched</em> in fury. She snapped her mandibles, taking a Soldier by the chest. He struggled as she lifted him. And Yellow Splatters struck the giant Shield Spider’s side.</p>
<p>The <em>crash</em> as the [Sergeant] hit the Shield Spider made Embria’s horse halt. Embria watched as Yellow Splatters punched, cracking the mother spider’s side, then reached up. He grabbed a huge leg, and <em>pulled</em>.</p>
<p>The leg came out of the body. Yellow Splatters ducked as the giant Shield Spider swung towards him, letting go of the Soldier she’d captured. The [Sergeant] punched away a huge mandible. He retreated, but only to use the leg like a club, bashing at the smaller Shield Spiders around him. And then the rest of the Painted Soldiers arrived. They leapt, grabbing at the giant spider, breaking her legs, hammering at her sides, killing the smaller ones.</p>
<p>In minutes the corpse had stopped twitching. The Soldiers moved past Embria and the silent [Captains] who’d answered her call. The Drakes and Gnolls watched as Yellow Splatters ran forwards. The Painted Soldiers streamed after him.</p>
<p>“Ancestors. Wing Commander. Is that what this new breed of Antinium can do? Some kind of improvement over regular ones?”</p>
<p>Captain Vell, unnaturally pale, breathed out slowly. She looked…uneasy. Embria couldn’t apply frightened to Vell. But Embria herself felt rattled.</p>
<p>“I’ll add more notes to my report. High Command is aware of this new type. But—damn them. They actually did it. That’s more than a Prognugator. That’s a leader.”</p>
<p>Embria glared at Yellow Splatters. She pointed at the [Sergeant]. Vell glanced at her, confused.</p>
<p>“There’s a difference?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”</p>
<p>The crimson-scaled Wing Commander bit out. She watched Yellow Splatters pointing and the Soldiers charging past him. They were too animated, even for Antinium Soldiers. She shook her head and then looked back at her officers.</p>
<p>“I never had the privilege of watching General Shivertail fight. Let alone General Sserys. But I heard that Zel Shivertail was no genius of strategy. And his army-wide Skills were few and far between. He was a monster in close combat and practically undefeatable there. But what made him terrifying was his skill as a leader. Not just a [Leader]. When he led, it was said that the Drake [Soldiers] who followed him turned into rampaging warbeasts, every last one of them. When he was fighting for home, no army from Baleros, Chandrar, the north, or anywhere else stood a chance. Because it was <em>him.</em>”</p>
<p>Vell’s eyes widened. Then her jaw dropped when she realized what Embria was implying. The Wing Commander shook her head.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s low level. Or maybe he’s just hiding his true abilities. It doesn’t matter. He may not have a Skill, but when he starts getting some—some leaders are like that. Some [Squad Captains] too. But they’re a different breed from planners, or even regular [Generals]. I hear the Bannermare of Baleros and the King of Destruction are both nearly as good as General Shivertail was.”</p>
<p>“But Wing Commander—the Antinium don’t<em> have </em>morale.”</p>
<p>Captain Pielt protested. Wikir growled in disgust. He slapped Pielt across the back of the head with a paw.</p>
<p>“That’s what you see, Captain Vell? Pluck out your damn eyes, then.”</p>
<p>The others went silent. They looked at Embria. She followed Yellow Splatters with her eyes. The Painted Soldier was moving on, letting his Soldiers clear nest after nest at breakneck speed. He was a reflection of her, standing alone. And that bothered Embria most of all. She saw him turn his head. And for a moment their eyes met.</p>
<p>Then Embria turned away in disgust. Disgust and unease. Because she wasn’t sure if she had seen an anomaly, or a new type of Antinium, one far more terrifying than even the flying monsters or the color-changing assassins. She looked at the quiet 4<sup>th</sup> Company and snapped.</p>
<p>“Well? Do you want them to take all the credit? Back to work! Blast those nests! Officers, use your best Skills! The Antinium may be machines, but they don’t have magic or Skills!”</p>
<p>“Yet.”</p>
<p>Vell muttered as she trudged back to her squad. Embria paused. And that one word scared her more than anything else. She turned back to watch. With the people of Liscor. The Painted Antinium marched on.</p>
<p>Onwards, across the Floodplains. Bright colors on dark shells. And they were laughing. Because he led them.</p>
<p>And he had come back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wow. That’s something.”</p>
<p>Erin Solstice stood on the hill outside of her inn, watching the battle. Well, it was charitable to call it a battle. It looked to her like pest extermination. The Shield Spiders certainly had about as much of a chance as regular spiders against the City Watch, the 4<sup>th</sup> Company and the Painted Antinium.</p>
<p>Maybe if they’d been the giant behemoths that had assaulted Tyrion Veltras’ army they could have fought back. But Shield Spiders of the smaller variety were dangerous to individuals. Not armies.</p>
<p>Erin wasn’t participating in the culling of course; she was just watching. With a glass of lemonade in one hand, the most appropriate drink in the world. She glanced at it as she took another sip through a wooden straw.</p>
<p>“I had <em>no</em> idea that lemons were this plentiful on Izril.”</p>
<p>“Not Izril. They’re usually native to Baleros. But Oteslia, one of the Walled Cities, is famous for growing plants from across the world. They drive the cost down. Although it’s still going to be a lot pricier than, say, cider. But we can sell this well. I’m surprised I haven’t ever had anything like this.”</p>
<p>Lyonette stepped up to watch with Erin. She had a pitcher of fresh lemonade in one hand. She glanced at Erin.</p>
<p>“Something else from your world?”</p>
<p>“One of the most popular drinks in the world. Besides Coke. It’s a classic.”</p>
<p>Erin sipped her drink absently. Lyonette nodded. She poured a small cup and reached down. A furry paw reached up for it.</p>
<p>“That’s your second glass. You only get two, Mrsha. And don’t share with Apista.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll nodded seriously. Then she drew a smiley face and patted her stomach.</p>
<p>“Oh? Glad you like it, Mrsha. We’ll try it on our guests tonight. But it’s really great for hot weather, you know. Either way…give me another cup, Lyonette?”</p>
<p>The [Princess] nodded. She handed Erin her cup and then filled another from a table. There were tables outside on the grass, and chairs. And customers. It was a special Shield Spider viewing morning, with a special on breakfast. Lyonette’s idea.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Erin handed Lyonette back her drink, took the new one, and went to find some of her guests. She slipped down one hill, balancing her drinks.</p>
<p>“Whoop. <em>Whoop!</em> Slippery! No, Mrsha, don’t follow. Who—ah, darn. Got some on my hands.”</p>
<p>She <em>tsked</em>, climbing up another hill with a much less steep gradient, and found a group at the top. Erin smiled and raised her cup.</p>
<p>“Hey! Anyone want to try some lemonade?”</p>
<p>The figures on the hill looked up. Pawn, kneeling in a patch of grass and pressing two of his hands to a Soldier’s leg, looked up. The Soldier was sitting on the ground. He had an open wound from which green blood was oozing. Or—had been oozing. Erin blinked. His leg was healed. The Shield Spider bite he’d suffered was closed. As she watched, Pawn drew his hands back and the Soldier flexed his leg experimentally.</p>
<p>“Nice. Using some healing potions, huh, Pawn?”</p>
<p>The Worker jumped. He hesitated, then nodded judiciously.</p>
<p>“I have been doing healing, Erin. Thank you. Fortunately, few Soldiers are getting injured. The Shield Spiders are not really a threat and Yellow Splatters is leading the others.”</p>
<p>“So I saw.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the Painted Soldiers, still killing nests. It had been four hours and they weren’t slowing down. Neither was 4<sup>th</sup> Company; the [Soldiers] seemed determined to win this competition, if it was one. The City Watch had decided it was not and started trudging back to the city. Erin anticipated guests to her inn. She decided Lyonette could handle it with the morning’s staff. She took another sip from her drink and smiled.</p>
<p>“Mm. Here. You want a lemonade, guys?”</p>
<p>She offered it to Pawn and the Soldier. The Soldier, who had bright green vines twining up his legs, looked at Pawn. The Worker hesitated.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>“Sweet lemonade. That’s lemons plus water. And sugar.”</p>
<p>“Ah. We can consume that. Please give it to Twisted Vines. I will have some later, if there is more.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Hello, Twisted Vines! Want some?”</p>
<p>Erin offered the Soldier the cup. Reverentially, as if he were receiving the holy grail itself, the Soldier clumsily took the cup. He raised it to his mandibles and gently poured some of the liquid into his mouth. He paused. Erin and Pawn watched. Then, slowly, the Soldier poured a single drop of the lemonade into his mouth. He paused. For twenty seconds. Then he did it again.</p>
<p>“Uh—”</p>
<p>Pawn nodded. He looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“He is savoring it. He doesn’t wish to waste the lemonade, Erin. It is delicious to him.”</p>
<p>Twisted Vines raised one of his free hands and nodded. He ducked it, almost timidly at Erin. Embarrassed, the [Innkeeper] looked at her nearly empty cup.</p>
<p>“He can have more! That’s what refills are for!”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless. Thank you, Erin.”</p>
<p>Pawn said it so genuinely that Erin had to turn and go bright red for a second. There was something off-putting about how grateful Antinium could be for a cup of lemonade. Even though she was used to it, it could <em>hurt</em>. But it also made the world clearer. Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“You’re going to tend to the injured here? You can do it at my inn, Pawn.”</p>
<p>“I should be closer to them. Just in case.”</p>
<p>The [Acolyte] rubbed two of his hands together absently. He watched as the Soldiers moved towards them. Erin nodded. She sipped, found her cup was empty, and nodded.</p>
<p>“If you like. I’ll be at my inn, reevaluating my life and being grateful and stuff. Come on over when you’re done! Bring your Soldiers! Lyonette wants to sell them stuff.”</p>
<p>“I will. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Pawn watched Erin go. Then he turned to Twisted Vines. The Painted Soldier was still savoring the cup, drop by drop. Pawn hesitated. Twisted Vines glanced at him, then carefully put the cup down. He stood up.</p>
<p>“You may stay. Finish your cup before you leave. That’s…necessary for your full recovery.”</p>
<p>The Worker ordered Twisted Vines. The Soldier glanced at his comrades, but did sit and pick up the cup. He drank, but more swiftly now. And Pawn stared at his hands.</p>
<p>All four of them. Then he looked at Twisted Vine’s leg. Gone was the visible interior flesh that had been exposed by the Shield Spider’s sharp mandibles. Pawn noted the remnants of the blood.</p>
<p>“Your wound doesn’t hurt? Did you feel any undue pain when I was—<em>healing</em> it? Does it feel functional now?”</p>
<p>Twisted Vines paused. He regarded his leg, then looked up and shook his head. Then he hesitated, and carefully put a thumb up. Purple Smiles must have taught him that.</p>
<p>“Good. Inform me if it does hurt afterwards.”</p>
<p>Again, Twisted Vines nodded. He sat on the ground, finished his cup of lemonade, and then stood up. Pawn realized the Soldier had no idea what to do with the cup.</p>
<p>“I will take it back to Erin. You may go. If you must.”</p>
<p>Twisted Vines nodded. He handed the cup to Pawn, then turned and rejoined his brethren. Pawn sat on his hill and watched them fighting. He felt a desire to be below. But he knew he would struggle to keep up just with the Soldiers as they ran. And he had been assigned to this hill, to relative secrecy. Because Klbkch did not want many people seeing Pawn using his new Skill.</p>
<p>A new Skill. And Yellow Splatters. Pawn didn’t know which surprised him more. But he took both. Oh, he took what he had been given. And he had never felt more grateful.</p>
<p>He was back. Yellow Splatters. And part of Pawn’s internal hell, his damnation, had eased when he saw Yellow Splatters. But the [Sergeant] was…more than he had ever been. Far more. In body and in other ways. Pawn saw the Painted Antinium moving closer to the inn. And he realized they were done, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>Soldiers were streaming back across the Floodplains, many towards the city. Some were collecting the more edible Shield Spider corpses for processing. The rest were following Yellow Splatters. He directed them with efficient movements of his four hands, using the silent communication method of the Hive’s Soldiers. And in that he was familiar to Pawn. The Worker raised a hand as he walked down the hill towards him.</p>
<p>“Yellow Splatters.”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked up at him. And then his mandibles opened in a smile. And he spoke.</p>
<p>“Pawn.”</p>
<p>And that word changed everything. Pawn halted for a moment. Yellow Splatters could <em>speak.</em> A Soldier could speak. But that wasn’t all. Yellow Splatters gestured to the Soldiers behind him with one hand as another pointed at the inn. Still two more were singling out Soldiers in the group behind him.</p>
<p>“I have two injured. Firestones, Azure Clouds, Pawn will tend to your wounds. The rest of you, proceed to The Wandering Inn. You will receive food there.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers obediently trooped ahead as two moved out of the ground. Pawn saw a bloody wrist on one of the four arms, and the second Soldier had a cut on one abdomen and cracks around his leg armor, perhaps from a bad fall. He reached out for them, even as he stared at Yellow Splatters, still with that awe.</p>
<p>He could speak. <em>Fluently.</em> Yellow Splatters had the natural intonation and speed of any natural speaker. He was better than <em>Bird</em>. And his voice was deep, commanding. Without hesitation. He was the same in many ways. But oh, so different.</p>
<p>“Let me heal you.”</p>
<p>Pawn directed his attention back to the two injured Soldiers. Firestones and Azure Clouds obediently let Pawn press his hands against their wounds. The Antinium Soldier with burning coals etched onto his body in paint didn’t move as Pawn put his hands over his cut wrist.</p>
<p>“Be healed.”</p>
<p>The words were simple. But the prayer Pawn gave for that very thing to happen were from the core of his heart. And part of what was in that prayer was doubt. Uncertainty. But also hope. And faith that his hope would be—Pawn took his hands back. And the wrist, though stained with blood, was whole. Firestones looked down at his wrist, and the Soldier’s antennae waved with amazement.</p>
<p>“You too, Azure Clouds.”</p>
<p>The other Soldier let Pawn put his hands on his legs and stomach. And when Pawn removed the hands, the wounds were healed. Just like that. A healing potion could have done the same, but Pawn <em>felt</em> the healing being done. As if some of him had gone into the two. He felt tired, but only slightly. And they were healed. Yellow Splatters nodded.</p>
<p>“Join the others. We will follow you.”</p>
<p>The two Soldiers nodded. They walked past Pawn. But Yellow Splatters stopped them with a hand on each shoulder as they passed him. The giant among Soldiers, barely more than a few inches taller than the two below him, looked at the two.</p>
<p>“You have done well. Eat and rest. It is earned.”</p>
<p>That was all. But the two Painted Soldiers walked with more pride back to the inn than Pawn had seen in them…ever. The Worker looked at Yellow Splatters as the [Sergeant] held a hand to help Pawn up.</p>
<p>“You are different.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two walked up the hill of The Wandering Inn slowly, side by side. Their heights were different. Their bodies similarly contrasting. But they were both Antinium. And they both knew each other. But Pawn felt like a stranger. Perhaps Yellow Splatters did too, because he kept glancing at Pawn.</p>
<p>It was one of the first times they had been alone. Since Yellow Splatter’s reveal in the streets of Liscor, that was. True, a day had passed. But Klbkch had kept Yellow Splatters moving, repeating his message of support for Krshia. And then the [Sergeant] had been surrounded by the Painted Soldiers. Pawn didn’t begrudge that. But now, walking with Yellow Splatters, he didn’t know what to say. He had a thousand questions. Ten thousand words. But how to begin?</p>
<p>“I am different. But the same. I can speak. And say the many things I would have before my death.”</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“Gratitude. Regret. Frustration—at not being able to say these things. Questions for you. Ideas. Things the Soldiers need. Questions. Thanks.”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked at Pawn. The Worker shook his head.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do enough. I was—”</p>
<p>“Our salvation.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“No, really—”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes.</em>”</p>
<p>Pawn looked up at Yellow Splatters. The [Sergeant] smiled. And they reached the inn bearing a silence more profound than any Pawn had shared with Yellow Splatters until now. And then Pawn saw the doors were wide open. And he heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Pawn! <em>Yellow Splatters!</em> Come in! Lemonade for my guys!”</p>
<p>Erin swept over to them in an instant. The tables were filled with Painted Soldiers—forty nine of them to be exact. Each one had a bowl and was eating as they watched a performance on stage. Erin herself came to Pawn. She beamed as she grabbed some lemonade off a tray.</p>
<p>“Here. It’s fresh. Want some soup? I’ve got a big pot of this really great soup Lyonette came up with. Here, sit, sit! It’s so good to see you, Yellow Splatters. I mean, we said hi.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] sat at a table offered by Erin. Pawn remembered Erin hugging Yellow Splatters after she’d found he’d returned. Even now she looked misty-eyed, but she was already waving for more soup.</p>
<p>“Here! It’s hot, fresh, and uh, probably not gluten!”</p>
<p>The bowl steamed as it appeared in front of Pawn. It was a clear broth with obvious bits of pork and what might have been <em>yellats</em> mixed in with some other greens. Pawn raised a spoon before he could help himself. Instantly, his mouth was flooded with <em>flavor.</em> It had been far, far too long since he’d come aboveground.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Really? I’m glad. This is only like fifty of the Soldiers, though, right? Are you bringing more in? Lyonette’s making a huge batch!”</p>
<p>Erin pointed at the kitchen. Pawn hesitated. Both he and Yellow Splatters had been given the morning’s orders by Klbkch, but he’d said nothing about the Soldiers having food. Just that they would meet him here.</p>
<p>“I…believe only fifty are normally allowed aboveground except for formal operations. But these Soldiers can rotate with the others.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. I’ll let Lyonette know. Oh! And we’ve got special spoons and bowls for them to eat with. I’ll get—”</p>
<p>Erin half-rose, glancing down at the table. Pawn looked down too and nearly dropped his spoon. He stared at Yellow Splatters.</p>
<p>“Your hands.”</p>
<p>Pawn hadn’t noticed it before, but even Yellow Splatter’s hands were different. Two of his four arms were a Soldier’s arms. Functional. Deadly. Capped by clumsy fingers more suited for making a deadly fist with than any other task. They could dig and fight and manipulate some things, but crudely. But the other two arms, the higher of the four, hand been changed.</p>
<p>The limbs were thick. Reinforced. Suited for combat. But the hands were <em>hands</em>. Five digits, like a Worker’s fingers had replaced Yellow Splatter’s previous hands. And they were gripping the spoon Erin had given him, meant for her regular clientele and Workers. As Erin and Pawn watched, he brought it up and transferred some soup into his mouth.</p>
<p>Delicately, carefully. As if he had always known how to use a spoon up till this moment. But he had never had a chance. Yellow Splatters looked up, noticing the stares.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Erin Solstice. It is good soup.”</p>
<p>Erin’s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“You can speak. I mean, I know you can. But…wow. You can <em>speak.</em>”</p>
<p>“I can. And I will never be silent again.”</p>
<p>Yellow Splatters looked at the two of them and nodded once more. He tapped his chest with one finger even as another grabbed his cup and a third lifted the spoon towards his mouth again.</p>
<p>“Before, I had no words. That was me. And then I had words but no voice. And now I have more words. And they come from the same silent Soldier. And from heaven. From the voices of the many who have never had the chance to speak.”</p>
<p>Pawn was struck silent. Erin just looked at him, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad. Listen—I want to talk to you two, but there’s a lot of guests. Just sit there and wave if you want anything. I’ve gotta actually do my job for a bit. Coming, Lyonette!”</p>
<p>She stood up and went for the kitchen where Lyonette had been waving at her urgently. Pawn looked back at Yellow Splatters. The [Sergeant] was silent as he ate his soup as greedily as any Soldier. Come to it—Pawn looked down and realized he was eating the delicious soup as well.</p>
<p>The Antinium’s meal was silent; they didn’t want to waste the food by talking, but it was interrupted near the end. A Drake and a Gnoll, regular guests, hesitantly came towards the table. The Drake nudged the Gnoll, and the Gnoll nudged back. They were both male, and at last, the Drake cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Hell of a thing. The uh, Shield Spider culling that was. We saw it from the walls. You’re…Yellow Splatters, right? The Soldier? The…war hero?”</p>
<p>Skepticism was written all over his voice. Yellow Splatters nodded. He put down his spoon and stood up. The Drake and Gnoll stepped back fast and the nearby tables turned to look, but Yellow Splatter’s voice was calm and measured.</p>
<p>“I am Yellow Splatters. [Sergeant] of the Painted Antinium unit of the Free Antinium. Son of Liscor.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Wow. Uh, a pleasure. Sisl Taltail. And this is my friend, Wilr. We were just asking—are the Antinium really planning on funding an expansion to Liscor?”</p>
<p>The Drake was clearly nervous and he didn’t hold out his claw to shake hands, which Pawn understood as being customary. But he didn’t run screaming either. Yellow Splatters nodded.</p>
<p>“Senior Guardsman Klbkch would not lie.”</p>
<p>“Of course not! I just—so the Antinium are willing to give gold to Liscor? Just like that?”</p>
<p>The Drake glanced around. And Pawn saw some more non-Antinium customers lean in. Yellow Splatters nodded coolly.</p>
<p>“We are pledged to defend Liscor. That also means defending the interests of the city. We do not break our promises. Vote for Krshia Silverfang. And we will build your city. Workers to build and Soldiers to guard. It is our city too, after all.”</p>
<p>He looked around. Sisl opened his mouth for a second, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay. Thank you.”</p>
<p>He backed off, staring at Yellow Splatters, but his Gnoll friend looked almost impressed. Yellow Splatters sat back down. Pawn stared at him as well.</p>
<p>“You speak with authority.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Should I not?”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked blankly at Pawn. The Worker hesitated.</p>
<p>“But where does it come from?”</p>
<p>The Soldier pondered the question. Then he kept eating because the soup was going cold. He raised one cup, sipped from it, and answered.</p>
<p>“Heaven, perhaps.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senior Guardsman Klbkch entered The Wandering Inn shortly after cleaning up some mud from his gear. He’d participated in the Shield Spider culling too, but the City Watch had vacated the field after the Painted Soldiers had proved so effective. Still, it was because of Relc’s tardiness that he and Relc reached the inn after the Painted Soldiers had been there for a good fifteen minutes. That irked Klbkch, slightly. He would have preferred to study Yellow Splatters in person. Because the [Sergeant], the unique Soldier among Soldiers was an enigma.</p>
<p>He had changed. Not that Klbkch had interacted much with the previous Yellow Splatters. But this new Soldier was different. Confident. Even outspoken. Had death changed him? Had a voice only unearthed what was there to begin with? Klbkch didn’t know. But today his mind was overfull with questions, speculations, and, perhaps, a bit of surprise.</p>
<p><em>Pawn and Yellow Splatters.</em> One was predictable, at least in part. Klbkch had known about the Rite of Anastases being a success, even if he hadn’t been prepared for the personality of the [Sergeant]. But Pawn?</p>
<p>“A Skill unlike any other. The <em>potential</em> of that power is…or is it not? I must know what Xrn thinks.”</p>
<p>The Antinium sat himself down at a table at the back of the room, observing Yellow Splatters and Pawn. A yawn came from his left.</p>
<p>“What was that, Klb?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, Relc. And I am still irate at you. You are more slothful today than usual, which is an impressive event.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“It is not a compliment.”</p>
<p>Relc sighed. He stretched out, and Klbkch leaned out of the way of an errant arm.</p>
<p>“Bite me. I’m <em>tired</em>, alright? I had to wake up super-early because of my kid—and she spars way too hard!”</p>
<p>“By that, do you mean she puts forth actual effort?”</p>
<p>“<em>Bite me.</em>”</p>
<p>“I will endeavor to do so if you continue irking me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah…hey! Close those mandibles!”</p>
<p>Relc sat up, groaning. He glanced at the stage and brightened.</p>
<p>“Ooh! New play! Awesome! Hey, mind if we get a closer seat?”</p>
<p>“I suppose it is not out of the question. I have to speak with my subordinates.”</p>
<p>Relc was already getting up, tail wagging as the Players of Celum began a play Klbkch didn’t recognize. He nodded absently.</p>
<p>“Cool, cool. Wow, it’s <em>busy</em> in here. Look at all these Soldiers. And jerks drinking <em>my</em> blue fruit juice. Which is yellow. Is that a new drink? Hey! Hey, I’ll have—damn. What do you want, Klbkch?”</p>
<p>“I will have an ale. And a bowl of the soup. Please order it for me.”</p>
<p>Relc raised a hand as he sauntered forwards. Klbkch walked towards the table with Pawn and Yellow Splatters. He sat across from them.</p>
<p>“Report.”</p>
<p>The two looked up, mildly startled. Klbkch stared at them. They were…it was so strange, looking at them. Not because of their bodies, but because of what they represented. An incalculable amount of worth each, where generations upon generations of Soldiers and Workers had died, sacrificed in the hopes of becoming exactly what they were.</p>
<p>But now Klbkch had them, he wasn’t certain what to do with them. He wasn’t certain he remembered…what it was like to have other thinking Individuals in his Hive. Could he trust them with the Antinium’s true purpose? Did his Queen? Klbkch didn’t know. But they were valuable.</p>
<p>And yet—Klbkch looked at them. And he felt little connection, little to emphasize or even sympathize with in them. They were so unlike the Antinium he had known.</p>
<p>He felt…old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Pawn still felt uneasy talking to Klbkch. Now that he had met so many people, even other Antinium, he could sense Klbkch’s reserve like a wall in front of him. The Revalantor of the Hive listened impatiently as both gave their reports. Yellow Splatter’s was shorter than Pawn’s; Klbkch listened intently as Pawn described healing four Soldiers.</p>
<p>“That aligns with both tests I had you perform. It appears your ability recharges itself after rest. Much like Skills in that category.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Pawn ducked his head. Klbkch stared at him. Then his gaze shifted to Yellow Splatters.</p>
<p>“Your combat ability is also improved, despite your loss of ten levels from resurrection. It is to be expected as well. The Free Queen had modified your body for improved musculature and performance.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Will all Soldiers become like me?”</p>
<p>Yellow Splatters looked at his hands. Klbkch shook his head instantly.</p>
<p>“Changing the…specific formulas of the Soldier’s creation is an intensive process. It is one thing to shape an Antinium as it is being formed. Another to make the process default, without the need for supervision. You are unique.”</p>
<p>“Then I will lead the Painted Soldiers. That is my duty.”</p>
<p>Again, Klbkch shook his head. The Revalantor’s voice was sharp, and Klbkch himself felt annoyed.</p>
<p>“Your duty is to survive. You are an investment in time and effort. Let other Soldiers die before you.”</p>
<p>He waited for Yellow Splatter’s affirmative, but the Soldier didn’t immediately give it. He stared at Klbkch, and the Revalantor felt a prickle on his carapace. If it had been any other Soldier before then, Klbkch would have taken that as a sign of potential Aberration or Individuality. Yellow Splatters folded two of his arms.</p>
<p>“I am unlike any other Soldier. I am their leader. That was why I was brought back. I lead them. So does Purple Smiles. We must lead because we do what they cannot. If we die leading from the front, that is inevitable.”</p>
<p>Pawn sucked in his breath. Klbkch just stared. It sounded like an echo of an argument he’d had once in the past. He hesitated. And something inside of him twisted. It was an unfamiliar, unpleasant feeling. Like when he had seen Erin hurt. But he felt it now?</p>
<p>“You have your orders.”</p>
<p>“But I am no Soldier. I am their [Sergeant]. I must show them courage.”</p>
<p>Klbkch sat back in his chair. Pawn was afraid, but Yellow Splatters didn’t look away. For a moment the Revelator just looked at Yellow Splatters and Pawn. And he felt the strange, pained, familiar tugging inside of him worsen. Like arrowheads, cutting into his heart.</p>
<p>At last he roused himself. Klbkch put thorns into his words this time. He stared at Yellow Splatters and opened his mandibles slowly.</p>
<p>“Courage? Courage is a value of heroes. Of champions, of other species. It is not an Antinium concept. We have had heroes. They are dead. And you cannot replace them, Yellow Splatters. You are not Galuc. He was Centenium. Taller than you. Stronger. You bear a flawed, incomplete copy of his body. You are weak. Weaker than I and far weaker than he. I know this. Because <em>I</em> am Centenium. You are a Soldier. So obey.”</p>
<p>He met Yellow Splatter’s gaze until the Soldier nodded. Klbkch turned to Pawn.</p>
<p>“And you. You can heal a smaller wound in moments. Six times in an hour. Any quality healing potion can do far better. This ability is unprecedented. <em>Useful</em>. But neither of you two have qualities invaluable to the Hive. Cultivating those abilities is your function.”</p>
<p>He felt a twinge of guilt at those words. Why? Klbkch forced it down and went on.</p>
<p>“Both of you are forbidden from discussing the nature of your classes or levels. Especially in Pawn’s case. Nor will you reveal any secrets of the Hive. Is that understood?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Revalantor Klbkch.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They said the words quietly. Meekly even. And Klbkch felt as if he were lecturing two rookie [Guards] in the City Watch. Only, he wouldn’t have used those words. There was need for empathy in the Watch. And Klbkch had a small attachment to some of the [Guards]. But Antinium weren’t the same. Soldiers and Workers were…</p>
<p><em>Disposable. </em>But these two weren’t. Klbkch hesitated. He could see hurt in Pawn’s expression. And Yellow Splatters?</p>
<p>They waited. Klbkch opened and closed his mandibles a few times. And that roiling feeling in his stomach forced the next sentences out of his mandibles.</p>
<p>“Continue exceeding my expectations. A rotation of…fifty Soldiers may remain aboveground at all times under supervision as per our agreement with Liscor. They may stay at Erin’s inn during permissible work hours, or continue patrolling the city.”</p>
<p>The two Workers couldn’t blink, but they did move slightly in shock. Klbkch stood up briskly. Yellow Splatters raised a hand.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch. May I also request a stipend for the Soldiers? As a reward—as motivation for further growth and advancement?”</p>
<p>Pawn held his breath. Klbkch never granted him a larger budget. The Revalantor hesitated. Then, almost grudgingly, he turned back and nodded.</p>
<p>“Four silver coins and six copper per Soldier or Worker. You may withdraw a lesser bag of holding for usage.”</p>
<p>Abruptly, he walked away. Pawn gaped with his mandibles open at his back. Yellow Splatters lowered his hand slowly. They looked at each other until Erin Solstice came back out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Hey! Sorry, I had to help make some food real quick. Was Klbkch just here? Was he nice? I heard him talking to you when I passed.”</p>
<p>“He is our Revalantor. His job is not to comfort us, Erin. He was very instructive.”</p>
<p>Pawn answered diplomatically, staring at Klbkch’s back. Erin pursed her lips, unconvinced. She leaned over and shouted at Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Klbkch! You’re a bad dad!”</p>
<p>Pawn froze up at his table. He saw Klbkch turn around in his chair. The Senior Guardsman eyed Pawn and then addressed Erin.</p>
<p>“I am not their father in any sense of the word.”</p>
<p>“Says you! Relc’s a better dad!”</p>
<p>Relc looked up as he slurped from a bowl. He laughed and slapped Klbkch on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hah! Hear that, Klb?”</p>
<p>“Do not hit me.”</p>
<p>Klbkch jabbed Relc with an elbow. He looked almost irritated at Erin, certainly at Relc. He was expressive with them. Not with Pawn or Yellow Splatters. The Worker wasn’t sure—no, he was sure how he felt about that. Erin put her hands on her hips in disgust.</p>
<p>“That guy. I’m gonna give him what for when I get to his table. But for now—sorry. I forgot to do this! Here, Yellow Splatters, lean in?”</p>
<p>“Lean wh—”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked up. He moved back and Erin surprised him and Pawn both by grabbing their shoulders. She hugged them both, a long, tight hug that warmed both Antinium from within. They stared at each other, and then at her. Pawn hesitantly reached a hand up. Yellow Splatters was still.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re back.”</p>
<p>That was all Erin said to Yellow Splatters. But her watery eyes said it all. She wiped at them.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I never got to say it, but thank you. When the Goblin Lord and—I saw your guys. And Pawn told me what you did. I’m so sorry—but thank you. I know it seems like they died for nothing. But you saved me. And I wish—”</p>
<p>She sniffed hard and wiped her eyes again. Pawn looked at Erin, aghast at her tears. He stood up.</p>
<p>“It was not in vain. They are in—”</p>
<p>A hand grabbed one of his. Yellow Splatters looked at Pawn and the Worker froze. Erin didn’t notice. She wiped her eyes again and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t in vain. I know that. Definitely. And I want to do something—oh! Hold on. Let me get something for you.”</p>
<p>She hurried back into the kitchen, calling for Lyonette again. Pawn looked at Yellow Splatters. He sat.</p>
<p>“Why did you stop me?”</p>
<p>“It is not for her.”</p>
<p>“What? Heaven? I know that. But she can know they are there.”</p>
<p>Yellow Splatters shook his head after a moment’s pause.</p>
<p>“But it is not hers.”</p>
<p>The Worker looked at him. Pawn opened his mandibles, but he couldn’t conceive of arguing. Instead, he sat closer to the table. And some of the questions bubbling away at him poured out.</p>
<p>“What is it like? Are there gods there? Is it in the clouds? How many—how many of us are there? Is it really…heaven?”</p>
<p>His heart beat anxiously in his chest. And he believed, he tried to believe, he truly did. But the proof sat in front of him. And when Yellow Splatters met his eyes, Pawn felt hope and something as pure as faith blossom in his chest.</p>
<p>“Yes. It is there.”</p>
<p>Pawn exhaled. Slowly. The feeling he had was—</p>
<p>“How? Was it always there? What does it—”</p>
<p>Yellow Splatters was shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Only those who believed could find it. And it was…”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] broke off. He reached up, his mandibles opening and closing, towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>“It looked like…felt…like…as…”</p>
<p>The words trailed off. At last, the Soldier sat back and shook his head. He met Pawn’s gaze.</p>
<p>“If there were words that could describe it, it could be built here. But there are not. It was…satisfying.”</p>
<p>“Satisfying?”</p>
<p>The Worker’s antennae waved in puzzlement. Yellow Splatters nodded slowly, mulling it over.</p>
<p>“More than that word. Yes. Satisfying. Peaceful. Warm. But fragile. It must be guarded and grown. By the Painted Antinium. They must know it exists, and fight for it. Fight to <em>live </em>so that death has worth.”</p>
<p>Each sentence struck Pawn like a blow. He wanted to fall to his knees. Instead, he gripped the table, overcome by wordless emotion. At last, he looked up. And his voice trembled.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry. I asked so much. I did not know the cost. If I could have, I would have died. But they all—all of them—”</p>
<p>It was what he’d wanted to say. Had to say. The words poured out.</p>
<p>“—should have stopped you. Or listened. Or done something better. The spells—I didn’t know. I had to do it for Erin. But I—I—”</p>
<p>He trembled like a leaf. Yellow Splatters looked at Pawn until the shaking words ran out and Pawn was just shaking. Then the [Sergeant] reached forwards with two hands. He rested them on Pawn’s shoulder, and two more found Pawn’s hands on the table. The Painted Soldier spoke.</p>
<p>“We forgive you.”</p>
<p>And if Antinium could but weep, Pawn would have. But he had not learned how. So he only sat, overcome, until Erin came back with something in her hands.</p>
<p>“Hey <em>guuuuuuuys.</em> Guess what I just got from our acid fly traps?”</p>
<p>The Worker and Soldier looked up. They’d had breakfast, but lunch appeared in front of Pawn. And this time—the Worker inhaled suddenly as Erin placed a cup and bowl in front of him.</p>
<p>“Blue fruit juice. Acid fly bowl, extra heaping. With an egg on top! Sunny side up!”</p>
<p>She spread her hands, beaming. Pawn stared down at the bowl in front of him and Yellow Splatters. Small, tiny black shapes, acid flies sans the acidic abdomens, were piled up in the bowl. A fried egg glistened on top of the black heap, just waiting for the yolky goodness to run down and flavor the acid flies.</p>
<p>“Acid flies?”</p>
<p>“It’s breeding season! And you know what that means! Lyonette just got a bunch. Sorry, we had to make sure Mrsha knew <em>not</em> to play around with them and Apista does not like them either. But yeah. This is the first bowl. Who’s my taker?”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at Yellow Splatters. Yellow Splatters stared at Pawn. They both answered at once.</p>
<p>“He is.”</p>
<p>Erin slapped her forehead.</p>
<p>“You two are too nice. Let me get another. And we’ll have some for all the Soldiers who come in today! Not huge portions; we’ve gotta build up a stock. But today?”</p>
<p>She looked at Yellow Splatters and put a hand on his shoulder, smiling.</p>
<p>“Free of charge. Until we run outta acid-flies and eggs. A back-from-the-dead special.”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked up at her. And for the first time since coming to the inn, Pawn saw him smile. And that was so familiar, that he felt a warm feeling in his stomach. Erin beamed. Behind her, Lyonette sighed. But she didn’t object.</p>
<p>“Well then. Blue fruit juice for all! Acid flies on the house for anyone who asks! Not you, Relc. And I present to you a new play by the Players of Celum! Enjoy!”</p>
<p>Erin waved at the stage and the [Actors], flushed with excitement, took a pre-play bow. Another bowl and cup appeared in front of Pawn. He stared at the little bugs. Yellow Splatters looked uncertain.</p>
<p>“I have never had these. I think.”</p>
<p>“You must. They are the best things to eat. Ever.”</p>
<p>Pawn reassured him. Yellow Splatters reached for his spoon, then hesitated again.</p>
<p>“The other Soldiers are waiting. They should have sustenance. There may not be enough.”</p>
<p>This was true. Pawn put a hand on Yellow Splatter’s.</p>
<p>“Yes. But there will be food for all who come. And you lead them. You must enjoy yourself.”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] paused, and then nodded. He reached for his cup with another hand and Pawn took his. They touched glasses, tentatively. And then both began to eat. On stage, the Players began their act. And Erin, pausing to argue with Klbkch, help serve food, came back to talk with them. And give another hug.</p>
<p>Pawn ate next to Yellow Splatters, deciding how long the Soldiers would get before they had to rotate out. He saw Lyonette overseeing the staff, radiant, and covered with a light sheen of sweat. A little white Gnoll crept up, sniffed his bowl once, and decided she wasn’t interested. And Pawn sat amid it all, in the inn where he had become him.</p>
<p>He had been happier before. Deliriously happy. Overjoyed. But this was deeper. Quieter. Perhaps even more filling. The word was…satisfying. And Pawn thought he knew what heaven might be like. Someday, he would find out. But right now?</p>
<p>He was just happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stream of Painted Soldiers entering and leaving Erin Solstice’s inn was obviously a good source of revenue. And the efforts of the Antinium in clearing the Floodplains had naturally aided in keeping the population of Shield Spiders down. And yes, true, the new play was sure to be of note to anyone who valued such things. But for Liscor, the happenings of The Wandering Inn were, for once, relatively unimportant. Because something big was happening to Liscor.</p>
<p>Elections. Democracy. The streets were abuzz with the idea of both. And that was the narrative which gripped the hearts and minds of Liscor. Because the world revolved around this issue. The story, the narrative of destiny depended on the outcome. It wasn’t about Antinium, or the inn. The main story was, obviously, <em>Liscor’s</em> story. How could it not be? And the Antinium and Yellow Splatter’s revival, for all they were significant, were just a part of the real narrative. Backdrop.</p>
<p>And the election for Liscor’s City Council was heating up. In the city for the third day running, traffic around Market Street came to a nearly complete standstill. But the street was hardly inactive.</p>
<p>Krshia Silverfang stood on a platform, created by a pair of [Carpenters] overnight. She didn’t cup her hands to shout this time; she used a small speaking amulet to amplify her voice. And she was not alone.</p>
<p>“If we want to build a better Liscor, it starts with a better Council, yes? Funding for the City Watch! A better Adventurer’s Guild! A larger city! Force the Council to hold an election! And <em>we</em> will get to work.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll woman waved at the people standing to her right and left. And the crowd of Drakes and Gnolls in equal numbers looked up and murmured at the other three figures on the platform.</p>
<p>Raekea, one of the finest smiths in the city and the best [Armorer] in truth. Elirr, a beloved [Beast Trainer]. Senior Guardswoman Beilmark, a veteran [Guardswoman] trusted by all. They waved at the crowd, and got cheers of support. Krshia raised her voice.</p>
<p>“You all know these Gnolls! Each one is respected! Each one would help change the city! Isn’t it better to know who is on the Council, rather than let them elect themselves? Why should we not have a voice? If you agree, find the Council members! Ask them why they are not allowing a vote! And remember—we can have a better Liscor!”</p>
<p>She raised her paws to a huge cheer. Because Krshia’s message was a simple message, and her plan was easy to grasp. You could articulate it after hearing it once. And the Gnoll’s speech had legs.</p>
<p>Selys Shivertail, sitting in the shade of one of the stalls on a stool, watched how many people were moving past or in and out of Market Street. It occurred to her that Krshia could use one of the city’s plazas, but here was the thing: you could avoid a plaza. It was hard to avoid one of the most frequently-used streets in the city. And Krshia was campaigning in this district. Assuming the election got passed. Assuming she won.</p>
<p>But they were good assumptions as far as Selys was concerned. She eyed a group of excited young teenagers hurrying away and shot a glance to her left.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re getting more and more people coming here to listen to Krshia by word of mouth alone. And a lot of people already heard her. Think they’ll put pressure on the Council?”</p>
<p>“If the eight different requests for a detail of [Guardswomen] to escort the Council across the city isn’t an indication, I don’t know what is.”</p>
<p>Watch Captain Zevara smiled crookedly as she watched the crowd. Normally this was the kind of thing she would be worried about, but the energy of the crowd pleased her in a perverse way. Here she was, subverting the natural order of law in the city. It was an odd feeling.</p>
<p>As were her co-conspirators. Zevara glanced down at Selys. The [Receptionist] was checking off her notes for the day’s rally. And she did have <em>notes.</em> Zevara had thought all Selys was good for was the money, but she was a [Receptionist], after all. The Drake nodded to herself and then looked up.</p>
<p>“Oops. Looks like Krshia’s going to hand off the speaking stone to Raekea. Good thing too; we should really buy a tonic for her throat, not just a healing potion. <em>Krshia! Hey, Krshia! Over here!</em>”</p>
<p>Selys waved to Krshia. The Gnoll’s ears perked up as she descended from the stage. The crowd surged around her for a moment, but let up as the burly Gnoll woman, Raekea, began to speak. Krshia was smiling, waving as she tried to push through to Selys—Zevara eyed her as she finally got there, panting.</p>
<p>“Maybe I should assign a few of the City Watch to you to keep you clear of the crowds, Krshia. You and your four candidates.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s better this way, yes? I can talk to people.”</p>
<p>Krshia panted as she wiped sweat from her brow, despite it not being that warm in the morning at all. Selys offered her a flask of water and Krshia drank greedily. She shook her head, sending a droplet of sweat onto Zevara’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I have been speaking all morning. Raekea will go next, then Elirr and Beilmark. They are the most popular, so I think they will be well-received. I have four more candidates, one for each district. We may not take them all, but we can <em>try</em>, yes?”</p>
<p>“We can do more than try. I think the Council will have to issue a vote. Six of them have said they’ll okay a vote. Maybe even by the end of the week? We have to keep the pressure up so they actually pass an election vote or they’ll definitely renege on their promise.”</p>
<p>Selys consulted her notes, frowning. Krshia and Zevara nodded in agreement. They both turned to look at Raekea. Krshia bared her teeth in a grin.</p>
<p>“She’s speaking well. And we’ll let her and Elirr hold this spot, yes? Beilmark has her duty, but she can answer questions on the job. And in the meantime—”</p>
<p>She pointed down the street. Selys nodded.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a crowd ready. And a stable platform for you to stand on. Need a stamina potion? A break?”</p>
<p>“Neither.”</p>
<p>The [Shopkeeper]’s eyes lit up fiercely. Selys smiled. She whistled, and when the heads of those nearby turned, a shift in the crowd revealed a group of Gnolls and Drakes breaking off from the rest. Krshia clambered on top of a platform held up by some of the strongest in the group—just in time. A <em>ratatatat </em>of drums and a loud, magically-enhanced voice heralded a new arrival. Lism and his supporters swept into Market Street with a squad of 4<sup>th</sup> Company marching at their head, trying to drown out Raekea’s speech.</p>
<p>But this time Krshia was organized. Her supporters were out in force, Gnolls <em>and</em> Drakes. And they outnumbered Lism’s side nearly two-to-one. Her crowd pushed forwards, forcing Lism’s back, and suddenly Raekea was calmly moving back as she continued her speech, carrying the curious crowd away from Lism while Krshia’s supporters and his clashed. The Drake [Shopkeeper] hissed as he saw a good number of his audience leave. He shouted at Krshia from his platform.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything better to do than blockade a street, Silverfang? Or is obstructing business really in everyone’s best interests?”</p>
<p>“I am simply speaking about a matter which concerns Liscor’s future, Lism. Why are <em>you</em> arguing against my plans? Is that in the city’s best interests?”</p>
<p>Krshia shot back. Lism rolled his eyes as he shouted at the crowd, some of which were already booing him.</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to this mad-Gnoll, people! Remember, she wants to have the <em>Antinium’s</em> help! Her plan about the walls is just inviting their trap. Don’t fall for it. We don’t need to even have an election, remember! She’s brought all this up, like some agitator, no, <em>[Saboteur]!</em>”</p>
<p>His words created a rumble from his crowd, but it was drowned out by the loud shouts of denial from Krshia’s side. She smirked at Lism as he colored.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this. <em>Don’t</em> do that. If you have better ideas, Lism, loudly shouting that you are, you should say them, yes? How would you fund new construction? Pay the City Watch? <em>Expand the Adventurer’s Guild?</em> Will the army pay for all of it? And did they have the coin all this time, if so, why did they wait until now to offer it?”</p>
<p>Lism hesitated, then ignored the question.</p>
<p>“We don’t need Antinium support. We’ll bring back <em>three</em> more companies—”</p>
<p>“Three hundred [Soldiers]? I’m sure that will stop every single threat that has assailed Liscor over the last year, yes? Giant Face-Eater Moths. Raskghar? An entire army? <em>Two?</em>”</p>
<p>“If <em>I’m</em> elected—”</p>
<p>“You just said we don’t need an election! Tell me, Lism, is it really an election you don’t want? Or is it that you want to bring our soldiers back? Which is it, hmm?”</p>
<p>Krshia smoothly interrupted Lism. The Drake choked and tried to shout over her, but his speaking stone was inferior to hers and she smoothly adjusted her volume to speak over his voice.</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> wouldn’t want to compromise our army’s ability to fight abroad, would you, Lism? I would rather our brave soldiers do the fighting without splitting their number. Wouldn’t bringing them back weaken our army? Four companies staying here—that is a fifth of our army’s strength, is it not? Would you weaken them so much? Where will we house them in the city? Oh. Wait. Perhaps we should <em>build more walls?</em>”</p>
<p>A roar of laughter drowned out Lism’s reply. And then a chant.</p>
<p>“Build more walls! <em>Build more walls!</em>”</p>
<p>Selys listened, smiling. She turned to Zevara.</p>
<p>“I like it. It’s catchy. I don’t know what bothers Erin about it.”</p>
<p>She looked back just in time to see Lism choking, waving for attention. The Drake’s voice was more than a little furious, and Selys heard the wobble in his tone.</p>
<p>“If—if you think—this is about the Antinium, people! Don’t forget that! You can’t trust them!”</p>
<p>“Oh? And I suppose the army is trustworthy? Where were they when the Raskghar attacked? The moths? What about the Goblin Lord? Where were they, Lism?”</p>
<p>And the [Shopkeeper] had no response. His eyes darted left and right as he struggled for an answer. And Krshia was already moving onto her next point. She caught Selys eye as she turned to the crowd and winked. Selys winked back.</p>
<p>Organization and strategy. There was a lot to be said for having a [Receptionist] on your side, and one of those things was planning out what you were going to say. This wasn’t a market-stall shouting match, and Lism really didn’t have a plan. This time Selys saw heads focusing on just Krshia, and even some of Lism’s supporters looked uneasy.</p>
<p>Because Krshia was right. They could either build Liscor out, expand the Watch, improve the Adventurer’s Guild…or do nothing. And who wanted to be on the side of nothing? There was always Lism’s plan of course, but it wasn’t solid. Selys turned to Zevara in delight.</p>
<p>“We’re winning. I’m pretty sure of that.”</p>
<p>The Drake nodded, smiling. She stepped over to speak to Selys when a group of Drakes pushed through the outer edge of the crowd. They made a beeline for Zevara and Selys. One of them, a Drake in his thirties, waved a claw urgently.</p>
<p>“Watch Captain Zevara. What do you think about this election? Are you really for it?”</p>
<p>Zevara turned smoothly and Selys settled back. It wasn’t the first time the Watch Captain had gotten this question. Zevara flashed a fake smile, which was her best attempt, and spoke to the lead Drake.</p>
<p>“Speaking solely as a personal citizen and <em>not</em> for the entire City Watch, I’m for Krshia’s proposal to expand our—er, the City Watch’s budgets. I approve of her spending plan and would welcome an election.”</p>
<p>“And this is really in the city’s best interests?”</p>
<p>The Drake demanded a touch incredulously. Zevara shrugged.</p>
<p>“I can tell you that the current Council has <em>not</em> approved any increase in the City Watch’s budget. Make of that what you will.”</p>
<p>The Drakes looked troubled. One of them, a woman, scratched her cheek scales.</p>
<p>“No increase? But that’s madness. If it’s that or doing this democracy thing—”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous. I hear one minute you’re having a little vote, the next there are useless [Senators] and [Politicians] up to your earholes.”</p>
<p>“If it’s that or pull in more of the army—”</p>
<p>“Have them quartered here, full-time? Causing trouble? I’d rather have the Antinium myself. Did you see them smashing those Shield Spiders this morning?”</p>
<p>The group began arguing. Zevara and Selys exchanged a delighted glance. <em>It was working</em>. And Zevara hadn’t needed to check her script! The Watch Captain stepped back with Selys, poised to answer more questions. Selys rifled through her folder.</p>
<p>“You can bring up the potential of more trade if Liscor begins actually farming the dungeon as a commodity. And I can talk about the uses of monster parts. Why don’t you—”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, a Drake pushed through the crowd. He was wearing armor and the insignia of Liscor’s Watch on his uniform. He waved a hand at Zevara.</p>
<p>“Captain, a word? There’s a bit of trouble by the brewery.”</p>
<p>Instantly, Zevara’s gaze sharpened. She took a step and then turned to Selys.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to handle this. Mind covering for me?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Selys watched as the two left through the crowd. The Drakes and Gnolls protested as Lism and Krshia’s shouting match continued in the background, but the two members of the City Watch were on business now. So it was Selys’ turn. She shuffled her notes, and then called out in a bright voice.</p>
<p>“I can answer any questions in place of Watch Captain Zevara!”</p>
<p>The Drake in his thirties turned to blink at Selys. He hesitated, and then squinted at her face.</p>
<p>“Hold on. Aren’t you that [Receptionist] at the Adventurer’s Guild? General Shivertail’s…what do you know about all of this?”</p>
<p>The [Heiress] put on her best smile. She took a deep breath, and then remembered something.</p>
<p><em>Liscor didn’t have a brewery.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selys was right. Liscor did not have a brewery. It had inns, taverns, both of which would make their own beverages with fermented barrels and hops in some cases. Or it imported alcohol. But a dedicated brewery was considered unnecessary; beer wasn’t that popular. Or great. Now, distilleries on the other hand…</p>
<p>Zevara knew this of course. It was a classic code the City Watch used. She followed the [Guardsman] through the crowd and back towards the City Watch barracks at a quick trot.</p>
<p>“What’s the real issue, Guardsman Tells?”</p>
<p>“Not for me to say, Captain. Sorry. I was just told to bring you.”</p>
<p>Zevara frowned and her tail began to twitch faster.</p>
<p>“By who?”</p>
<p>For an answer, Tells pushed open the door to the barracks. Zevara walked inside and saw a crowd of twenty one Drakes. Three Gnolls. They were mostly off-duty, but she knew each one. And she recognized the Drake waiting at their head. Zevara paused, and her mind raced as she slowly looked around.</p>
<p>“Senior Guardsman Jeiss. Guardswomen. Guardsmen. How can I help you?”</p>
<p>The crowd of Liscor’s finest—and only—law enforcement shifted. It was Jeiss, Beilmark’s partner and one of the most respected Senior Guardsman pairs who answered.</p>
<p>“It’s this election thing, Watch Captain. We’ve been listening to the gossip, and it sounds like the Council will actually hold an election. Are you really for Krshia Silverfang?”</p>
<p>The group behind him shifted uneasily. Zevara folded her arms, but she wasn’t about to shout them down. This was different, and she knew that Jeiss calling her out was…well, she wasn’t going to shout. She chose her words carefully, working off of Selys’ script.</p>
<p>“I’m not for putting any one person in power if that’s what you’re asking, Jeiss. This is certainly <em>not </em>a coup or something if you’re worried. For one thing, we aren’t the army even if we are the City Watch. Krshia Silverfang wants a seat on the Council, and I’m giving her my aid. But it stops there. She’ll do what’s best for the city and I don’t expect to control the Council. I’ll swear that on a truth spell first off.”</p>
<p>The [Guards] in the room relaxed slightly on hearing that. Zevara made a note to do it even if they didn’t ask at the end of this. You had to prove what you said or they’d wonder. She went on.</p>
<p>“It’s my decision <em>as an individual</em> that we need funds. The City Council’s refused my proposals three times. I can’t expand our ranks or get better gear any other way. So, yes. I’m willing to push for elections even if it means accepting the Antinium’s support.”</p>
<p>There was a murmur at that. Jeiss bit his tongue and looked at the others.</p>
<p>“Okay, Watch Captain. But…turning this into an election? It just feels like we’re going against the laws of the city, like Shopkeeper Lism’s been saying. And I respect Senior Guardsman Klbkch. But you know, the Antinium…”</p>
<p>He looked at Zevara and shrugged. She bit her tongue. The crowd was mostly Drake, but she knew how they felt. And she agreed in part, especially about the Antinium. She sighed, scratching at her neck.</p>
<p>“Jeiss, if I thought there was another way, I’d take it. But you saw what we’re up against. Krshia offered me funding for the City Watch. The current Council won’t. They rejected my offer three times, citing ‘lack of funding’. If it meant getting the City Watch what we need, I’d back anyone in an election. Anyone except that crazy Human.”</p>
<p>A chuckle ran through the crowd. Jeiss smiled, but then it faded.</p>
<p>“And the Antinium?”</p>
<p>Zevara looked up.</p>
<p>“We let them expand their Hive with the city. We put more Soldiers on the walls, and let more into the city. If they wanted to stab us in the back, they could have done it any number of times over the last decade. That’s my perspective. You have a different one?”</p>
<p>She waited for Jeiss’ response. He bit his lip shook his head reluctantly, and then sighed.</p>
<p>“If you’re doing this, your job’s in jeopardy too, Captain.”</p>
<p>Zevara nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“I know that. The next Council could replace me. Or this one might if things go south and Krshia doesn’t get her vote. Either way, that’s my decision. The City Watch stays neutral. I’m just a private citizen. With a lot of influence. I won’t ask you to do anything to support Krshia or help me keep my job. Got it?”</p>
<p>There was a lot of nodding, which was encouraging. Zevara had seen City Watches turn against their Watch Captains and that wasn’t a pretty sight. Jeiss looked around. He collected some invisible census, and then briskly shook his head.</p>
<p>“No worries on the job, Watch Captain. We’ve got your tail. You’re the boss, not Wing Commander Embria or the army.”</p>
<p>She exhaled softly, trying not to show her relief. It meant a lot.</p>
<p>“If that’s all, we’ve got a job to do. Anything else?”</p>
<p>She looked around. No one else wanted to speak, but Jeiss held up one claw.</p>
<p>“If—if there were a better option, Watch Captain, would you take it?”</p>
<p>Zevara paused. She looked quizzically back at Jeiss.</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“Just a hypothetical question, Watch Captain. I’m just saying. Will you keep an open mind?”</p>
<p>He met her eyes. Zevara nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“An open mind. If you’ve got any better ideas, I’ll listen.”</p>
<p>She waited. Everyone looked around, but no one spoke up. Jeiss shrugged, grinning tiredly.</p>
<p>“Just asking.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Turns out Lism can be shut up. You just need to get him mad enough to choke on his own spit.”</p>
<p>That night, Selys raised a glass and toasted Krshia and Zevara. The Gnoll was grinning, and her voice after a small gulp of a specialty healing tonic for the throat was back to normal.</p>
<p>“We got a message throughout the city. And Lism, that windbag, couldn’t stop me, even with two squads of the army marching.”</p>
<p>“And the Council is being hounded to act. They meet tomorrow morning by popular demand. If they don’t vote for an election, they’ll have to answer to a crowd. I suppose I should put some of the Watch on the scene just in case.”</p>
<p>Zevara drank from her cup, smiling faintly. Selys leaned back at her table, grinning hugely. She felt <em>powerful.</em> Or maybe motivated was the word. It felt like everything was coming together and relaxing at Erin’s inn after a hard day was excellent. As was the lemonade drink. And on cue, Erin came over with a pitcher for a refill herself, and tonight’s dinner.</p>
<p>“Congratulations! Krshia! Selys! Uh, Zevara! This is amazing!”</p>
<p>She set down three large, steaming plates of spaghetti and meatballs, a classic. Selys immediately reached for a fork and slurped up some noodles. Krshia picked up a meatball with her paws, popped it into her mouth, and chewed with her eyes closed. Zevara eyed Erin.</p>
<p>“Uh, thank you, Miss Solstice. This is good…lemonade, was it? I’ve had something like this. Not nearly as sweet, though.”</p>
<p>“You know us Humans! We love sugar.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at the table. She put the pitcher down.</p>
<p>“I also have another drink for you to try. On the house! I’m supporting this election. Although I can’t vote. But I really want you to win, Krshia! And the other Gnolls too. Mrsha was really happy Elirr was running!”</p>
<p>She came back with a clear glass with a brown liquid at the bottom, and a blue one balanced on top. Selys eyed it with great interest, as did Zevara. Krshia was eating meatballs.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Blue fruit juice mixed with rum. Try it. I’m going to show it to my friend in Pallass, Rufelt, later. Thoughts?”</p>
<p>“Nice presentation.”</p>
<p>Zevara took the glass, swirled it until the liquids mixed, and took a sip. Her brows shot up.</p>
<p>“Not bad. But it’s so <em>sweet.</em>”</p>
<p>“Some people like sweet. Like me. Erin, can I have one?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Krshia?”</p>
<p>“I could use a drink. Especially after dealing with Lism.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll stretched out. Erin nodded, smiling, and went for the bar. Selys reached for her fork, sipping from both sweet drinks. Zevara requested an ale. Selys bit into her spaghetti, and noticed a paw sneaking up to one of her meatballs on the side.</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>The little Gnoll jumped, hit her head on the table, and raced away. Zevara jolted—Krshia just rolled her eyes. Her meatballs were safely in her stomach. Selys laughed and tempted Mrsha back with a meatball.</p>
<p>“What are you, a dog?”</p>
<p>“Gnoll cubs are sometimes indistinguishable from them. And often less well house-trained.”</p>
<p>Krshia muttered. Mrsha shot her a frown, stood up on both legs, and delicately bit off half of Selys’ meatball. She folded her arms, as if to say, ‘there! See?’ Krshia just blew air into Mrsha’s face teasingly.</p>
<p>“Don’t feed Mrsha more than that, Selys! She’s begged enough snacks already. I’m telling everyone to stop; she’s putting on weight! And for once, she doesn’t need it!”</p>
<p>Lyonette passed Selys’ table by, carrying a bowl filled with black flies to a table with some of the Painted Soldiers, still being rotated in from the Hive. It was night, but they were still eagerly coming in and watching the Players of Celum, who had rotated through their three acting teams throughout the day.</p>
<p>“You’re not fat, are you, Mrsha?”</p>
<p>Selys teased Mrsha. The Gnoll indignantly patted her stomach, glaring at Lyonette. She flashed her paws in a signal Selys didn’t understand, but Lyonette clearly did. The [Barmaid] frowned thunderously as she handed a Soldier a bowl.</p>
<p>“Say that again young miss, and you can kiss your <em>own</em> dessert goodbye. In fact, I don’t think a rude young lady deserves any. Do you?”</p>
<p>Mrsha’s face fell. She raced around Selys, hugging the Drake. Selys flicked her tail at Mrsha.</p>
<p>“I’m not protecting you from Lyonette. If you were rude, you were rude.”</p>
<p>The little Gnoll looked at Selys, betrayed, and then slunk to another table to Selys’ left. She poked her head up and surprised a half-Elf sitting there. Ceria rubbed Mrsha’s head.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! What are you doing now? Hiding from mean Lyonette? Sorry. My [Ice Walls] can’t stop her. Go say sorry.”</p>
<p>She ushered Mrsha out from the table. The Gnoll plucked at the woman sitting next to Ceria. Yvlon looked down and read something.</p>
<p>“A mistake? I don’t think so. Own up, Mrsha. Honesty is important.”</p>
<p>Selys wished she’d been at the inn longer to pick up on Mrsha’s new sign language. Guiltily, she looked over at the Horn’s table. Mrsha slunk back to Lyonette, ears down, and Selys cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“How’s it looking from your end? Think this election thing’s a good idea?”</p>
<p>They turned. Ksmvr, Ceria, Yvlon, Pisces—and Olesm. Both Pisces and Olesm had returned from Pallass yesterday, but this was their first full day experiencing the new climate. Ceria shrugged as she bit into her own spaghetti.</p>
<p>“I’m for it. Then again, I’ve never lived anywhere for long as a citizen. Adventurer’s Guilds let teams do their own thing. And Wistram was…well, confusing. This is nice and straightforward. Hope you win.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded.</p>
<p>“No disagreements there. And it seems like you three have the popular opinion on your side. What do you think, Pisces, Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>The two looked up from their plates. Both seemed intent on winning the award for most spaghetti consumed. Ksmvr opened his sauce-covered mandibles.</p>
<p>“I am no longer a member of Liscor in any sense of the word since I was expelled from the Hive. Therefore all my thoughts about Liscor’s election are voided.”</p>
<p>“…Fair enough. Pisces?”</p>
<p>The [Necromancer] looked up with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Ah, naturally the one expert on Drake politics and culture is addressed <em>last, </em>as usual.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. Selys rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Big talk for a Human with more sauce than lips.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ hand went up and touched his spaghetti-sauce covered lips. He blushed, scrubbed at his face with one arm of his robe, and cleared his throat. Yvlon gave Selys a thumbs-up which Pisces ignored. He sat back, steepling his fingers together.</p>
<p>“I for one quite enjoyed the spirited debate. I may have added in a few salient points of my own.”</p>
<p>“Hence you nearly getting into a fight three times?”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed Pisces over the rim of her cup. The [Necromancer] sniffed and adjusted his pristine white robes.</p>
<p>“Trifles. A good debater always has an exit strategy prepared in case simpletons unable to mount a coherent defense take objection. Isn’t that so, Olesm?”</p>
<p>He looked at his companion. The Drake [Strategist] didn’t immediately reply. Olesm looked up from his mostly-untouched plate of spaghetti.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe all this happened when I was gone. Is this really happening? An election? And—you’re all going for it? Krshia? Selys? Zevara?”</p>
<p>He looked at them from his table. Selys frowned and Krshia and Zevara looked up at Olesm’s tone.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Why? Isn’t it a great idea?”</p>
<p>“I—I suppose so? I mean, I’m for elections. In theory. I guess. I’m not against it. But this deal with the Antinium—and expanding the walls? Can we secure them by next spring against the flood waters? And what about getting them enchanted? If they aren’t, we’re potentially giving someone a foothold into the city.”</p>
<p>He looked at Zevara. The Watch Captain frowned and put down a napkin.</p>
<p>“I think we can do it. There’s a Wistram [Mage] scheduled to check our walls soon for the annual inspection anyways. And if not this, then what? What are your objections, Olesm?”</p>
<p>“The Antinium’s deal for one. Politically, if we allow Antinium from foreign Hives into the city—no, it’s the expanding Hive that bothers me. <em>And</em> allowing more Soldiers aboveground. Why didn’t anyone consult with me first? I am Liscor’s [Strategist]!”</p>
<p>The blue-scaled Drake looked upset. Guiltily, Selys sipped from her drink and shrugged. She didn’t really get his objection. Erin came back with more meatballs for Ceria and Krshia.</p>
<p>“Mrsha said sorry! So don’t let her beg more meatballs, anyone. What’s this about more Antinium being a bad idea?”</p>
<p>Olesm avoided Erin’s gaze. He mumbled as he forked up more spaghetti.</p>
<p>“Well, I meant the Hive in regards to the Free Queen, not the Painted Soldiers…er, I’m just saying, it’s a deal worth looking twice at.”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned, resting the point of his chin on his steepled fingers. Yvlon raised an eyebrow, but Ceria just sighed.</p>
<p>“You sound just like that Lism guy, Olesm.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>He hunched his shoulders defensively. Selys remembered he and Ceria had been a thing briefly. Or had they? The half-Elf chewed, swallowed, and burped.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Well, that Drake’s clearly against non-Drakes. He’s anti-Human and frankly, I don’t see why anyone supports him. I’m only half-Human and <em>I</em> was offended listening him to rant about Humans and filthy Antinium and conniving Gnolls.”</p>
<p>The rest of the table nodded. Krshia nodded and Selys looked at her sympathetically. She called to Ceria.</p>
<p>“That’s Lism. Well-known Drake [Shopkeeper] on Market Street. Krshia has to deal with him all the time.”</p>
<p>“Oh? My condolences.”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her mug. Krshia nodded. Olesm protested weakly.</p>
<p>“Hey now.”</p>
<p>He was cut off by Erin, who leaned over the Horn’s table, dishing out more meatballs for Ksmvr—none for Pisces. The [Necromancer] obligingly stole them off Ksmvr’s plate instead.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about Lism? Let me tell you, that guy. Whatta jerk. He’s been mean ever since I came to Liscor. Someone should hit him with a wet fish or something. I really hope he gets into the election—and Krshia kicks his butt!”</p>
<p>She raised a tong over her head. Ceria laughed. Olesm looked upset.</p>
<p>“Aw, come on, Erin. I know he can be—but he’s my <em>uncle.</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. I forgot. Sorry, Olesm.”</p>
<p>Erin blinked at the Drake unapologetically. Then she headed to Selys’ table and offered her pot of meatballs. Krshia took six.</p>
<p>“But come on. Even if he is family, isn’t he a bad guy? He tried to scam me first time I met him! And he’s rude. And grouchy.”</p>
<p>“And his tail sucks.”</p>
<p>Selys added with a nod. Zevara’s lips quirked.</p>
<p>“Is it really that bad?”</p>
<p>“Ugly tail. Ugly personality. His has a crook in it—”</p>
<p>“Selys!”</p>
<p>Olesm cut Selys off from sketching the objectionable tail in question. He looked around, his shoulders hunched, his tail lashing the floor.</p>
<p>“I won’t deny he has his faults. But that’s not all he is. You don’t know him.”</p>
<p>“I know what I hear. And I see an angry Drake who’s attacked Ksmvr twice when he’s walked past him for no good reason. I’ve seen racists before, Olesm. That’s what he looks like to me.”</p>
<p>Yvlon calmly ate from her plate with a knife and fork. Olesm’s tail stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>“I know he doesn’t like Antinium. Or Humans. But he helped raise me. He can be kind. Stop it. Please.”</p>
<p>The Drake looked around and both tables went quiet for a moment. Krshia sighed.</p>
<p>“Lism is…Lism. Market Street would not be the same without him, this is true. And he has his points, which is why he is free to run against me. I just intend to win.”</p>
<p>The others looked at her and smiled. Ceria grabbed a mug.</p>
<p>“I’ll drink to that! Good luck, Krshia! Win this thing and get on the Council! Upgrade the Adventurer’s Guild too, please? That’s what we want.”</p>
<p>The mood around both tables regained its cheerfulness. Pisces raised a mug.</p>
<p>“To a flawless victory. May you overwhelm your opponents on all fronts.”</p>
<p>“More like drown them in votes. Lism’s the only opposition to Krshia and she’s got tons of support. We’re slated to get four seats at the moment—we could aim for eight, maybe!”</p>
<p>Selys tipped her mug up and drank her lemonade down. Krshia grinned. Erin laughed.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Beat that Lism jerk! Teach him a lesson for insulting Numbtongue.”</p>
<p>Zevara raised her eyebrows as she lifted her ale.</p>
<p>“I remember that. I heard someone tried to drown him afterwards.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed.</p>
<p>“Wish they’d succeeded.”</p>
<p>“<em>Shut up!</em>”</p>
<p>Olesm’s claws <em>slammed</em> onto the table. The tables—no, the entire room went silent. The Drake looked up at the stage full of [Actors] across from him, the Painted Soldiers, regulars, Relc making a fist—he turned red.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Thanks for the drink. I’ve got to go. Zevara. Can I have a word?”</p>
<p>He grabbed for some coins abruptly and pushed his chair back. Erin opened her mouth, wavering.</p>
<p>“Olesm—”</p>
<p>“Watch Captain?”</p>
<p>Olesm shook his head. Zevara stood up. She looked at Krshia and Selys.</p>
<p>“I’ll be a moment.”</p>
<p>Quickly, she and Olesm walked out of the inn, through the door to Liscor. They didn’t even need help; the mana stones were now labeled on the dial. The door closed as the silent inn watched Olesm go. One of the [Actors] coughed on stage. Ceria turned guiltily to her team.</p>
<p>“Oops.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr raised a slow hand.</p>
<p>“In fairness, Captain Ceria, drowning is a very horrible way to die. I would prefer disembowelment over drowning myself.”</p>
<p>He looked around at the silent table.</p>
<p>“No? Just me? Strange.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Olesm walked swiftly down Liscor’s streets for a good thirty seconds before slowing. He turned back, the scales along his cheeks dark with color.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. We were being insensitive. I apologize.”</p>
<p>Zevara folded her arms, her heart skipping a beat. She’d mostly forgotten her burning desire to ask Olesm out, but sometimes it resurfaced in inopportune moments. She schooled her face, though. Olesm seemed serious. Watch Captain Zevara cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“Did you have something you wanted to talk to me about, Olesm? About the proposed deal with the Antinium?”</p>
<p>Olesm nodded curtly. He took a few breaths to steady himself, and then crossed his claws behind his back. When he looked at Zevara, it was seriously, his previous embarrassment and anger put aside.</p>
<p>“I heard what you agreed to. Allowing the Hive to expand? Increasing the limit of Soldiers permitted aboveground? Giving other Hives <em>access</em> to Liscor? Zevara, with respect, are you<em> insane?</em> That deal favors the Antinium in huge ways!”</p>
<p>Zevara’s stomach sank. She didn’t like the disapproval in Olesm’s eyes. Reflexively she crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“I’m aware of the implications, yes. But elaborate for me. Why is this in particular so egregious? The Free Antinium have been in Liscor for over a decade now. They’re already protected by the peace treaty. What’s wrong with letting in a few foreign Antinium?”</p>
<p>“Besides the fact that they could give the other Hives valuable information or force us to allow them to pass into our territory under diplomatic privileges? That’s not my biggest worry. It’s allowing their Hive to expand. It’s <em>dangerous!</em> Why would you allow any deal involving that?”</p>
<p>Olesm glared at Zevara. She glared back and pointed at the ground under their feet.</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t I? It’s an easy concession to make! You and I both know that the current Hive has exceeded its boundaries, Olesm. And they maintain far more Soldiers in their Hive than the agreed-upon three hundred. These are paper promises.”</p>
<p>The Drake took a deep, frustrated breath.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. We regularly use a [Geomancer] to send probes into the earth. We can tell—to a certain distance—whether there are tunnels belowground. The Hive can probably dig below the [Geomancer]’s range, and I’m certain they do. But it still impedes their overall capacity. But if the city expands and the Hive is allowed to expand with it, the danger they represent will exponentially increase.”</p>
<p>“As will the City Watch. We could potentially double our numbers! And Liscor itself will expand!”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point!”</p>
<p>Olesm clutched at his neck spines agitatedly. He stomped one foot on the ground, and then gestured to one of the houses on the street.</p>
<p>“The Antinium are far, far more efficient than Drakes, Humans, or any other species in the world in terms of space. If Liscor expands, the Antinium will gain two Workers or Soldiers for every new person we can house. And they are <em>all </em>potential combatants.”</p>
<p>That silenced Zevara for a second. She gnawed at her lip.</p>
<p>“Even so, we’ve always known the Hive was large. They’ve always outnumbered the City Watch. That’s why we have safeguards in place.”</p>
<p>“Safeguards that account for a certain number of Antinium and being able to hold parts of the city!”</p>
<p>Olesm’s raised voice made a shutter fly open. The two Drakes heard an aggrieved shout.</p>
<p>“Shut up down there! Stop talking about the election! I’m trying to <em>sleep!</em>”</p>
<p>They hurried back, keeping their voices low. Olesm hissed at Zevara, his tail lashing.</p>
<p>“The Antinium have always been able to overwhelm Liscor, Watch Captain. At any moment, if their Queen orders it, they could storm the city and I would give them the odds of winning. The only thing that saves us is that it is not advantageous for the Antinium to do so. And the fact that there is a chance, a decent chance, that any sudden attack would fail, due to the safeguards we have in place. If we give them more concessions, like having <em>six hundred Soldiers</em> aboveground at any moment…the odds begin to favor the Antinium more and more. If we give them an incentive, the Free Queen—no, the Grand Queen might decide—”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>The Watch Captain cut Olesm off. He blinked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Zevara folded her arms. They’d come to a rest in an alleyway, completely sanguine about the dangers. A potential mugging would be welcome at this moment; Zevara’s tight throat and burning lungs made her want to spit fire at something. She contained more than a few wisps of smoke from leaving her mouth.</p>
<p>“I said, I know, Olesm. I haven’t been a Watch Captain the entire time the Antinium were here. But I’ve been briefed. I’ve had conversations with the High Command, the leaders of the other Walled Cities…I know what’s at stake. They may call Liscor a backwater border city, but we are the lynchpin between north and south. And more importantly, we <em>are</em> the experiment. I know how deadly an Antinium siege gets. Don’t you think I do?”</p>
<p>“Then why—”</p>
<p>“To fight the Goblin King, we allowed the Antinium into Liscor. That was the deal. But there was another reason. We wanted to learn about the Antinium. Study their weaknesses. But now, I think some of the original [Diplomats] in charge of the deal were still hoping, thinking it might lead to…peace.”</p>
<p>Zevara looked past Olesm. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“Peace? With the Antinium? With all due respect, Watch Captain, that’s insanity. We still have border conflicts. Deaths each week! The other Hives are <em>not</em> content to remain sedentary, and we’ve had Aberrations in the city, which we have never proven are an actual flaw among the Antinium—”</p>
<p>“I know all that, Olesm. Shut up for a second. That’s an order.”</p>
<p>Zevara waited for Olesm to be quiet. She went on, clenching a claw.</p>
<p>“I know. I know the risks. I know the Grand Queen. I’ve read the reports on the other Hives. But there’s something else I’ve learned. I know Senior Guardsman Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Olesm was quiet. Zevara went on, pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>“I remember when I first met him. Of course I knew the stories. And of course I watched him like a hawk. And he’s given me reason to watch him—but he’s also been honorable, hard-working—Ancestors, if he wasn’t an Antinium, I’d be worried he’d take my job! A lot of the city hated the Antinium when they first arrived. But thanks to one Antinium, one person, now not even Lism can attack Klbkch directly without losing most of his supporters. And Klbkch is a Prognugator—no, a <em>Revalantor</em> of the Hives. I have to trust that there’s more than just an opportunity for peace. And if one Hive might make peace with us, that’s one sixth of the Grand Queen’s armies. I trust Senior Guardsman Klbkch, Strategist Olesm.”</p>
<p>She met the shorter Drake’s eyes. Olesm’s blue scales shifted in the moonlight as he studied Zevara. He was breathing fast with agitation, and thinking too. At last, he shook his head.</p>
<p>“I know Senior Guardsman Klbkch too. But I don’t know Klbkch the Slayer. And I know this. To him, we are all dust.”</p>
<p>Zevara stared at Olesm.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“His words, Watch Captain. I don’t agree. I understand your reasoning, but I think you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>The knife twisted in Zevara’s stomach. Coldly, she stepped back.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re free to that opinion. But I’ll remind you that I’m not using my authority to unduly shape the election. I am allowing Krshia Silverfang a chance, but I am supporting her as an individual, which is my right. The City Watch may vote to their conscience. As may you.”</p>
<p>Olesm looked up at Zevara. He narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll have to do that. I’m sorry, Watch Captain.”</p>
<p>He turned and walked away without another word. Zevara stared at his back and tail until they disappeared. Then she leaned against the alley wall. She sighed, slowly.</p>
<p>“…Great.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Krshia and her small team were celebrating the day’s victory at The Wandering Inn, a similar committee was burning the midnight oil.  Literally. It was midnight, and the lantern was using cheap oil. It smelled, but none of them were [Mages] or even capable of casting the [Light] spell. Lism <em>hissed</em> as he rubbed one claw across his reddened eyes.</p>
<p>“Okay. Make an appointment with Wing Commander Embria. Request that two squads join us for our counter to Krshia down Market Street. And if she can spare a third, it would be best used marching wherever those other candidates go. Remind people of the <em>real</em> defenders of Liscor. Now, how in the hells do we figure out how to put a hole in that stupid Gnoll’s plans? Anyone?”</p>
<p>He looked around the table. A group of weary Drakes—and one Gnoll, stared back. All of them, mostly Lism’s age or older, shook their heads. A Drake with grey scales with only hints of speckled orange leaned on the table.</p>
<p>“She’s got the Council by their tails, Lism. They’re going to vote for an election. I can feel it in my scales. And if she runs with all those Gnolls—they could take the Council. Put all those laws through. You can’t argue her ideas don’t sound good.”</p>
<p>Lism’s brows darkened. His voice rose impetuously.</p>
<p>“Sound good? Oh, they <em>sound</em> good, I’ll grant you. But they’ll sell the city to the Ants and open us up to a hostile Human takeover. Did you hear her saying how she’d reach out to all the Human cities if she was elected today? As if they won’t bleed us dry! You all know her proposals are as rotten as ten-day-old fish. None of you would be here if you thought she was <em>right.</em>”</p>
<p>The table slowly nodded. But Lism didn’t like the exhaustion in the eyes of his fellow Drakes. And one Gnoll. He glared to his left.</p>
<p>“Shazzi! You know the Gnolls around your home. Can’t you talk sense into them?”</p>
<p>An old, fierce Drake clutching a cane even in her seat looked up. Shazzi, a retired [Seamstress] who could still sew like a monster, shook her head, pursing her lips.</p>
<p>“Not me. They’re all too afraid to cross Krshia Silverfang. She’s some big shot in her tribe and everyone who came with her supports her unconditionally. Plains Gnolls. And the rest won’t speak up.”</p>
<p>“Damn. Cellic. What about you? Can’t you rally more support for the army? What happened to patriotic Drakes waving the flag? Cellic? Cell—”</p>
<p>The Drake across from Lism woke with a start. He was far from the oldest Drake here—he was actually in his mid-thirties, but a large scar crossing the back of his head had left a divot in his skull. He looked up, befuddled.</p>
<p>“What? Did I—what’s that, Lism?”</p>
<p>The [Shopkeeper] hesitated. He eyed Cellic, and then looked out the window. Nothing but darkness greeted him. Lism looked around at the other faces and modulated his tone and put a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing, Cellic. It’s clearly late. You should get some rest.”</p>
<p>“No, no. I’m fine. I’m here if you need me. Say the word, Lism.”</p>
<p>The retired [Soldier] protested mildly. He blinked and unconsciously reached for the scar at the back of his head.</p>
<p>“I’m just…”</p>
<p>He yawned and drifted for a second. Lism looked at him, and then around.</p>
<p>“Someone take Cellic back. Make sure he gets some sleep in his bed. On his front, mind! Anyone? Tess, will you…?”</p>
<p>“On it.”</p>
<p>A Drake in her twenties sighed and plucked at Cellic’s shoulder. He awoke with a violent start and for a second his claws opened. Then he caught himself.</p>
<p>“I’m…sorry. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“A nap, Cellic. We’re all going to sleep. You’ll be the thing tomorrow. I’ll be counting on you.”</p>
<p>Lism jovially laid a shoulder on Cellic’s arm. The Drake looked at him and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll be there bright and early.”</p>
<p>He let Tess guide him from the room. Lism rubbed at his eyes and looked around. A morose team stared back. The old Drake with orange scales shook his head again.</p>
<p>“We could just petition the Council not to go ahead with the election. Point out exactly why it’s not necessary.”</p>
<p>“Can we stop half the city from following them around? Wait. Maybe. We could…form protective squads. Keep busybodies back. Maybe. I’ll think on it. But it’s late. You all need sleep. You’ve got your jobs, after all.”</p>
<p>The conference table looked at each other and reluctantly nodded. Lism clapped his claws together.</p>
<p>“Go, then. Thank you for your time. Anyone who can spare it, come here tomorrow. But if you’re hurting for coin—I’ll have a plan by the time you wake up.”</p>
<p>He smiled. Unconvincingly, he knew. But the others just murmured agreement and left, patting him on the shoulder, pledging to be here. Brave souls, fighting for what was right. Lism saw them off, and then went to sit back down.</p>
<p>His house was much, much quieter without the group sitting around his dining room table. The Drake sat in a chair, restlessly turning back and forth, getting up to pace.</p>
<p>“Maybe if I—no. Damn. And if I argue with her on—no. <em>No!</em> That won’t work either! If the High Command would only sign over enough money to match the Antinium! Can’t they see what will happen? And Wing Commander Embria’s not being cooperative. Her and those idiots blindly supporting—<em>Silverfang!</em>”</p>
<p>He uttered the name of his mortal enemy like a curse as he had so many times before. Only this time, Lism couldn’t see a way to beat her. He kicked over his chair with an oath.</p>
<p>“That damned furball—”</p>
<p>“<em>Uncle!</em>”</p>
<p>The sharp voice made him spin. Lism’s hand instinctively went for the knife at his belt, but the voice and the face instantly made him relax. A surprised smile crossed his face. He spread his arms.</p>
<p>“Olesm! My boy, it’s been too long!”</p>
<p>The surprised younger Drake with blue scales was enveloped in a hug. Lism clutched his nephew tightly, smiling fit to burst. Suddenly his problems seemed distant, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>“Come and sit! Don’t mind the mess. We’ve just had a late night planning out this election nonsense. Can I get you some tea? A snack? I’ve got some scraps—let me put a kettle on!”</p>
<p>He fussed around Olesm, but the younger Drake was reluctant to sit. He was restless, and his brilliant scales and handsome face—Lism saw the family resemblance. Handsome, regal even, and intelligent. All the marks of the Swifttail clan. He beamed at Olesm.</p>
<p>“It’s been over two weeks! But I imagine you’re beating ladies away with your tail. How is work? Liscor’s <em>[Strategist].</em> And you’re not even thirty years old! You’ve got more levels than years! Wall Lord Ilvriss himself picked you out. If that’s not a sign of greatness, I don’t know what is. Has he reached out to you since returning to his city? Let me get you some tea.”</p>
<p>“He hasn’t. And I’m not fighting anyone off with my tail, Uncle. Stop fussing, please.”</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Olesm finally sat down. He looked up at Lism and frowned.</p>
<p>“And don’t use that word, please!”</p>
<p>“Word? I was just frustrated.”</p>
<p>Lism spread his claws innocently. Olesm folded his arms.</p>
<p>“You used it in public to address Krshia. <em>Uncle!</em>”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say fur<em>bag.</em>”</p>
<p>Olesm ground his teeth together audibly and Lism sighed. The younger [Strategist] pushed his chair back.</p>
<p>“It’s still insensitive to the fact that we used to <em>skin</em> Gnolls during the old times. It’s as—as—it’s as bad as if I called you a Human-kissing Turnscale. No, far worse!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. It was my mistake. But that damn—Silverfang’s caused this mess in Liscor and I’m trying to sort it out. Give me some credit for stress!”</p>
<p>Lism sighed. He couldn’t deny his nephew anything. He doted on Olesm in fact, never mind that the boy sometimes hung around with that terrible Human girl and had moped for <em>weeks</em> after his fling with that half-Elven adventurer who’d nearly gotten him killed. But Lism’s heart swelled with fondness for Olesm. He was the family’s pride, after all. Never mind what anyone else had thought. Lism had known Olesm since he was a hatchling. And Olesm had never betrayed his hopes.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see you, Olesm.”</p>
<p>“Me too, Uncle. Me too. I’m sorry I haven’t called on you. I’ve just been—busy.”</p>
<p>Olesm smiled, but he didn’t look happy to see Lism. He looked tired. Tired, worried, distraught—Lism felt like he was looking at a mirror. The [Shopkeeper] cast about his modest home and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“We-ell, why don’t you tell me what’s been happening to you? I could use a break from this business with Silverfang. Don’t worry, I’ll stop her from ruining this city.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Not to worry! I can do it!”</p>
<p>The Drake waved a claw. He sat back, opening his mouth and eying his nephew. Then he coughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, no. Don’t worry. I’ll figure something out. I haven’t sold copper pennies for silver pieces for years without picking up some tricks. And I know you’re friends with that stinking—with that insane—with that Human girl and Watch Captain Zevara <em>is</em> your superior. It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Olesm sighed, leaning forwards on his knees.</p>
<p>“Erin’s a wonderful person, Uncle. I told you already. If you hadn’t tried to swindle her—”</p>
<p>“Overcharge her. It’s not illegal!”</p>
<p>“She’s a really good person. The best chess player. In the world! I’ll swear she could beat the Titan himself. And Krshia’s a good person too.”</p>
<p>“She’s got you fooled, my boy. You can’t trust her. She’s as slippery as a greased eel and twice as treacherous as a Creler.”</p>
<p>“She’s trying to help the city, Uncle!”</p>
<p>The Drake paused.</p>
<p>“You think so too?”</p>
<p>For some reason, the thought of Olesm siding with Krshia stung more than any of the Gnoll’s damned barbed insults this morning. The blue-scaled Drake, a far cry from Lism’s purple-and-red scale colors, more like his mother than anyone else, shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m not…all for her. But I know Krshia. I know her heart’s in the right place. So is Selys’ and Watch Captain Zevara’s…I just spoke with them, actually.”</p>
<p>“Did you now.”</p>
<p>Lism sat down heavily. For a second his mind flashed to Krshia’s arguments, seeking a hole in them. But the problem was…Olesm looked up at his uncle. The single oil-burning lamp flickered, wafting a bit of stink towards the two. Neither one moved.</p>
<p>“Uncle. I came here because I wanted to ask you about the elections. Krshia’s ideas. Her proposing them. You’re her biggest enemy. Tell me honestly. Please. Is this really just about you hating Krshia’s ideas? Or are you serious?”</p>
<p>Lism squirmed like a fish on a hook. He opened his mouth, looked over his shoulder, but he couldn’t escape his nephew’s gaze. Reluctantly, at last, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying she’s all wrong. She’s…right we need to expand Liscor. Rent’s up, and we’re all feeling the pinch. Just the other day, Mella, you know her, right? The old [Florist] on Salpik Avenue? She was turned out of her apartment without anywhere to go. After living in her spot for eighteen years, only now she can’t pay the rent because it’s nearly tripled from two years back.”</p>
<p>Olesm rubbed at his face, shocked and mildly horrified.</p>
<p>“Mella? She used to babysit me. What happened to her?”</p>
<p>Lism was indignant.</p>
<p>“The neighborhood association got to her is what it did. You think we’d let her freeze to death? We put her up with Miss Shazzi. They get along like cats—or two Drakes—in a bag, but it’s manageable. You can imagine the stories, though.”</p>
<p>Olesm laughed quietly.</p>
<p>“I can. I should visit her. Or see about that [Landlord]. Evicting someone from a house at Miss Mella’s age? That could be a death sentence. And triple the price? I’ll check on it tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Lism nodded, proud as any father. Prouder than Olesm’s, certainly.</p>
<p>“That’s the [Strategist] of Liscor for you. Never too large to notice the honest folk.”</p>
<p>“But it just proves Krshia’s right, doesn’t it, Uncle?”</p>
<p>Olesm looked up, fixing Lism with another stare. The [Shopkeeper] hesitated.</p>
<p>“Well…okay, she has a point. And maybe the Adventurer’s Guild could use some coin. And I won’t say I’m against the City Watch expanding—Ancestors, of course I’m for it! It’s just…”</p>
<p>The younger Drake folded his arms, waiting. Lism grabbed at his neck spines. At last the words exploded out of him.</p>
<p>“It’s just her! That Human-loving Gnoll thinks we can cozy up to any warm-blooded Human. She thinks we can rely on the Antinium for help—and she’ll toss out our entire system of government to do it! Just because <em>she</em> wants power. And she’s wrong. The Antinium aren’t our friends. Hah, we saw that during the First Antinium War, didn’t we? Even if a few can walk about without killing anything in sight—and those Humans! We had an army at our gates not a month back! Has everyone <em>forgotten </em>that?”</p>
<p>Olesm shook his head.</p>
<p>“No one has, Uncle. But I’ve heard you speaking. You talk about filthy fleshbag Humans. About Gnolls getting ‘out of their place’. About other species—Uncle, they’re not all evil. I’ve told you that. Not even all Goblins are bad.”</p>
<p>Lism was quiet. He leaned on his table, and then looked up.</p>
<p>“So? So what? Should I apologize? Change my views? They’re not all evil. But it’s not ‘all’ of them I’m worried about, Olesm. It’s the ones who rule. Tyrion Veltras. That [Lord] tried to take Liscor. He would have slaughtered—<em>slaughtered</em> the entire city and started a war. But for luck, he didn’t. Should I forget that? When? In a month? A year? A decade? What about what Humans have always done? We welcomed the Five Families when they first came. In return, they betrayed us, burned our Walled Cities, slaughtered us in the north and took half a continent away.”</p>
<p>His claws shook as he gripped the table, staring at Olesm. The [Strategist]’s face was bleak.</p>
<p>“I know. But that was millennia ago, Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Have they changed? Should we forget? I don’t like them. I don’t trust them. And I’ve always been honest about that. I don’t put on a fake smile and stab them in the backs. Why do I have to pretend to like them? Why do I have to like them at all? Why can’t I hate them for what they’ve done? What they do? Why do I have to say ‘oh, some of them are <em>different?</em>’”</p>
<p>Olesm bowed his head. He shook it a few times as Lism paced back and forth. The [Shopkeeper]’s voice shook.</p>
<p>“I can live with them. Isn’t that enough. Or will Krshia pass a bill forcing me to duck my tail and smile at every Gnoll and Human who passes my way? Why the Antinium? Why not—not let Drakes and Gnolls build the city? We used to have [Builders] once. Honest work for honest folk. And then the Antinium came with their damn workers and put hundreds out of a living.”</p>
<p>He paced up and down, airing old grievances, angry, despairing. And he felt guilty, because he knew Olesm didn’t agree. He didn’t want to see his nephew’s look, so Lism kept ranting. Right up until Olesm stood up.</p>
<p>“Uncle. Enough.”</p>
<p>And Lism was quiet. He turned to Olesm.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, my boy. But I’m not going to stop fighting Krshia. And if I have to be the last one kicking and screaming, I’ll oppose her right up until she becomes a member of the Council. If I can just stop it&#8230;”</p>
<p>His tail thumped the floor helplessly.</p>
<p>“You know, lots of the Drakes in the city feel just like I do. More than half of the ones I spoke to were uneasy about an election, about messing with the system, the Antinium and Humans. It’s just that when that damn Gnoll sounds so convincing with her talk of free money, people lose their heads. We <em>are</em> Drakes, after all&#8230;”</p>
<p>Olesm looked at him, and then he half-smiled. Bitterly, tiredly.</p>
<p>“I disagree with a lot of what you said, Uncle. And if you keep saying it, I can’t—won’t help you. But you’re right about one thing. The Antinium. And if you’re willing to think about what’s good for the <em>city</em>…I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>Lism paused. He stared at Olesm. His nephew looked up at him. Lism didn’t hesitate. He spread his arms wide, beaming.</p>
<p>“For you? Olesm, my nephew? I’ll try. Tell me what you’re thinking.”</p>
<p>Olesm sighed, closed his eyes. And then he pulled out a quill, inkpot, and began to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Selys hummed as she strolled down Market Street, getting ready for the big day. This was it. They’d push the Council to begin an immediate election, put out four more candidates for the Council, and then—<em>win.</em> She couldn’t wait. She was so excited, she was practically vibrating. She saw a crowd had already gathered next to a promenade. They were gathered around something. A council member? Were they having a debate? Selys slowed. And then she stared.</p>
<p>“Ancestors. What is <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Krshia, Zevara, and the rest of the Gnoll candidates were standing in a group, looking up at the large poster made of parchment posted on a wall high up, for all to see. Zevara read it out loud, not even needing to squint to read the words.</p>
<p>“<em>Jobs for Liscor. Build your city with your own claws/paws!</em> What in the name of Dragons…?”</p>
<p>“Is this something you did, Krshia? Anyone else?”</p>
<p>Selys turned to the group. Beilmark, Elirr, Raekea, all of them shook their heads. Selys looked around, puzzled, and then she heard a familiar sound.</p>
<p><em>Ratatatat.</em></p>
<p>“Oh no. I thought we beat him yesterday!”</p>
<p>She groaned. Krshia uttered a few Gnoll curses and turned, calling for her crowd to form up. But to Selys’ surprise, this time Lism wasn’t heralded by a huge crowd. Instead, he was walking on his own two feet, followed by a gathering of onlookers—but not the vehement protesters that usually shouted insults at Krshia’s supporters. And the drummer was no [Soldier], but just a regular Gnoll [Drummer], banging a brisk beat on the drum.</p>
<p>“Vote for a better Liscor! Vote for walls! Vote for economy, independence! Vote for a Liscor you built yourself!”</p>
<p>Lism shouted, cupping his hands to amplify his voice even further with the aid of his amulet. Krshia, poised to ride the platform over the heads of the crowd, appeared with a large group of Gnolls. She stared down at Lism and looked around. It was almost comical without the huge crowds of yesterday. Krshia coughed, embarrassed, and called down at Lism.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Lism? Causing more trouble? Is this your doing?”</p>
<p>She pointed at the huge flyer above the street. Lism smiled, shading his eyes to see.</p>
<p>“Ah. Like it, Krshia? Yes, it’s mine. Courtesy of a few [Scribes] I know! But I see they forgot to add my name to this particular one. It’s my campaign’s slogan. Like it?”</p>
<p>He gestured up at the flyer. The crowd looked at him, clearly confused. So did Krshia. She folded her arms.</p>
<p>“So you’re <em>for</em> an election suddenly? Are you flip-flopping on your word again?”</p>
<p>Lism gave her a huge smile.</p>
<p>“Only because I’ve had a change of heart! Yes! I am for an election! And we <em>should</em> build a new part of the city! By all means!”</p>
<p>He raised his hands. And the crowd behind him cheered. It was, after all, what Krshia had been saying all this time. Completely off-guard, Selys stared at Zevara, whose brows were completely raised. Krshia stared down at Lism. Then she realized where she was and awkwardly climbed off the podium.</p>
<p>“So you’re acknowledging mine is the good idea, yes?”</p>
<p>Lism studied one claw.</p>
<p>“It’s…a good idea. But I’d rather <em>I </em>take the Council seat. You see, I am running in your district, Krshia. And if <em>I’m</em> elected, I’ll ensure that we expand our city by one <em>third</em>, fund the Adventurer’s Guild and fund the City Watch! Build those walls! Build those walls!”</p>
<p>He raised his hands and the crowd cheered behind him. Krshia stared. Then she spluttered.</p>
<p>“What? You can’t say that? That’s—that is <em>my</em> promise, no?”</p>
<p>Lism smiled beatifically.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s my promise too. I’ll ensure that Liscor gets exactly what it needs, but unlike honored Krshia here, people, I’ll do it <em>right!</em> Lism for the City Council!”</p>
<p>He raised his arms again, but Elirr thrust his way forwards. The older Gnoll shouted at Lism.</p>
<p>“Do it right? You just stole Krshia’s idea!”</p>
<p>The Gnolls around him roared the same thing. Lism shouted back.</p>
<p>“Not at all! I improved it! You see, <em>I</em> won’t rely on Antinium to build the wall! I’ll hire honest Drakes and Gnolls to do it!”</p>
<p>The words stunned Elirr into silence. Lism waved a claw around.</p>
<p>“Yes, Krshia has the right idea. And expanding Liscor is the best way to combat this ludicrous rent! But why let the Antinium do it? Think about how many jobs a project like that would create! Thousands! And the money would go into your pockets, not back to the Antinium for such a huge building contract! And I have more—”</p>
<p>“Wait, but that’s—”</p>
<p>Selys was scrambling, tearing through her notes to figure out just what—but Lism was going on.</p>
<p>“Krshia would have us open the city to adventurers from the north. I say, look to our tails. The Bloodfields have always been a deterrent to trade coming north. But with that fabulous door, and our brave soldiers, couldn’t we seek a safer path through the hills around the Bloodfields? Cut a path to enable trade throughout the year? This is just one of the proposals, which I, Lism, would implement if I am elected to the Council. Fund the City Watch! <em>And</em> bring our soldiers back! They could keep our roads safe! Why stop where Krshia is content to coast? Vote for me and let’s get as much done as we can!”</p>
<p>This time the cheer was drowned out by Krshia’s <em>howl </em>of fury. She advanced on Lism, pointing an angry paw.</p>
<p>“You cannot say that! You stole my idea!”</p>
<p>“It’s just an idea, Silverfang! If you can’t improve on it, what’s the point?”</p>
<p>Lism crowed as he looked around. He got nods of agreement. Some people clearly disagreed, but Lism’s banner was waving above his head. <em>Build your city with your own claws.</em> Selys clearly heard a Drake lady remarking to a friend behind her.</p>
<p>“Why <em>not</em> hire Drakes and Gnolls? My son could use a job.”</p>
<p>“But how will <em>you</em> pay for the wall? Without the Antinium’s help?”</p>
<p>Krshia snarled at Lism, losing her composure. The Drake rubbed his claws on his tunic.</p>
<p>“Well, the army has pledged some money to Liscor. But—happily, three of the Walled Cities have already pledged to cover five percent of the costs rather than force the Antinium to pay. <em>Each.</em>”</p>
<p>Selys’ jaw dropped. Krshia took a step back, her fur paling.</p>
<p>“That is a lie. You cannot have—”</p>
<p>“Reached out to the Walled Cities? Let’s just say they’re concerned about the Antinium too. And they’re willing to help pay for an expanded City Watch—we may be able to fund the Adventurer’s Guild’s upgrade solely based on private donations!”</p>
<p>“Private—”</p>
<p>Krshia’s eyes bulged. Lism reached for something behind him. A Drake carrying a sheaf of…of papers handed a small stack to him. Lism pressed it into Krshia’s paws with a filthy smile.</p>
<p>“It’s just been printed. But the reaction is already spreading across the continent. I’m sure I have a few [Messages] waiting. But until then—Drakes and Gnolls, lend me your ears! Do you want to have the Antinium expand their Hive and build everything? Or would you rather build your city yourselves, and see the gold flowing into your pockets?”</p>
<p>He walked past Krshia, shouting at the crowd further down the street. The procession followed him and Selys saw to her horror that people were breaking off, talking to each other. Spreading the word. It was a twisted parody of yesterday. Selys rushed over to Krshia. They had to stop Lism! Think up a counter! But the Gnoll was staring at something in her paws. Her hands were shaking as Selys rushed up.</p>
<p>“Krshia, what—”</p>
<p>The Gnoll growled. Her eyes flashed as the papers crumpled in her grip. She thrust them at Selys.</p>
<p>“That dirty, <em>rat-tailed</em>—”</p>
<p>Selys stared at the papers. Slowly, she unfolded the crumpled paper, read the freshly-dried ink. It was in fact, a [Scribe]-written copy. A copy of a rather long introduction. The first thing Selys saw was the author’s name. <em>Olesm Swifttail.</em> With a sinking heart, she began to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>To my remaining readers,</em></p>
<p><em>My name is Olesm Swifttail, [Strategist] for the City of Liscor. In my previous newsletter I made a series of suggestions and recommendations about a possible system that could be implemented along with an analysis of the events surrounding the Goblin Lord’s recent siege of Liscor. I understand it was received with much chagrin by a good number of my audience, not least for the idea of fostering peace with the Goblins. I would like to address that issue in brief:</em></p>
<p><em>To those I have offended, I sincerely apologize. My arguments were not backed up with historical fact, which do cite instances where Goblins have coexisted with other species—albeit a relationship fraught with tension. I have since educated myself, and hope this further, more coherent argument will better represent my opinion—and the inherent dangers I was suggesting.</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to delve into the realities of trying to work in harmony with species classified as monsters, such as Ogres, Trolls, Goblins, various ape species, Giants, (with the understanding that the remaining half-Giant tribes are of course, now fully recognized as a species with rights in all cases but those of the Demonfolk of Rhir), and so on. </em></p>
<p><em>But before that, I would like to bring up another issue troubling Liscor: that of an election. I consider it a fascinating case-study of politics and will be attaching my opinion over a troubling change in Liscor’s traditional system of governance that may, inadvertently, grant too much power to the Antinium Hive located beneath Liscor, known as the Free Antinium. </em></p>
<p><em>My attached summary and thoughts are below, and in this newsletter, I have tabulated the letter to clearly differentiate games of Chess, Go, my findings on the issue of interspecies politics and strategy, and the current situation in Liscor. </em></p>
<p><em>Please also note the final section, which contains a fascinating report by Liscor’s Adventurer’s Guild on the species known as </em>Raskghar, <em>an exceptionally savage, monstrous subrace that deviated from Gnolls and their biology, danger classification, and the situation which lead to a large tribe abducting Gnolls from Liscor itself for a ritualistic sacrifice which has many disturbing implications…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh dead gods.”</p>
<p>Selys slowly raised her head from the paper. Zevara, looking bewildered, snatched at it.</p>
<p>“What is it? What does it say?”</p>
<p>“Olesm. He released another newsletter. And he not only talked about Goblins, but he’s talking about the Antinium in it. About the <em>election.</em> It probably went out to every city on the continent with a [Strategist] in it. And I <em>bet</em> they read his letter with that opening. He just told all of them what’s at stake!”</p>
<p>Elirr’s fur went pale. He read the cover letter over Zevara’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Olesm? He’s siding with Lism?”</p>
<p>Selys opened her mouth. Then she covered it because she wanted to throw up. No wonder the Walled Cities had just gotten in touch with Lism! If Liscor’s [Strategist] pointed out that they could help fund Liscor’s expansion <em>or</em> let the Antinium get a number of concessions…</p>
<p>Lism’s voice was coming back this way. He was marching at the head of a crowd, and he wasn’t by himself this time. A Drake was marching on his left, another on his right. Lism raised his voice jubilantly.</p>
<p>“For your consideration, good folk of Liscor! Senior Guardsman Jeiss for a seat on Liscor’s Council! Alonna Swiftwing, our esteemed [Mage] and head of the Mage’s Guild for a seat on Liscor’s Council! Vote for them! Vote for me! Liscor, built by our own claws! Or paws!”</p>
<p>The Gnolls watched him march down the street. Zevara stared at Senior Guardsman Jeiss. He saluted her awkwardly. Beilmark, his partner, said not a word. Jeiss avoided her gaze. Selys watched as more Gnolls and Drakes turned to listen to Lism’s new message. And then she realized the worst part.</p>
<p>“Oh no. He’s making this an issue about the Antinium. Not about building more of the city. If he can offer what the Antinium can—then it’s about whether you trust Klbkch and his Hive or not.”</p>
<p>“And whether you want Antinium to build the city or…us.”</p>
<p>The group fell silent. Selys thought she <em>would</em> puke. And then, a Drake approached their group. He was the same one from yesterday. And like yesterday, he made a beeline for Zevara.</p>
<p>“Watch Captain. Are you supporting Miss Krshia here? Are you against Shopkeeper Lism? He says he’ll support <em>tripling</em> the City Watch’s budget if he can. And he says he’s all for you as Watch Captain. Are you against him?”</p>
<p>Every head slowly turned to Zevara. She cleared her throat once. Twice. Three times. Selys beseeched her silently, but Zevara wouldn’t meet her eyes. Eventually, she looked at the Drake.</p>
<p>“Well, if—if any Council member were to see fit to grant the City Watch an appropriate budget, I don’t know that I could categorically denounce Shopkeeper Lism’s proposals…”</p>
<p>“<em>Zevara!</em>”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>The Watch Captain murmured. The Drakes looked at each other. One of them whistled.</p>
<p>“Well in that case…I mean, I’m supportive of the Antinium and all that, but I wasn&#8217;t <em>too</em> keen on having that many Gnolls on the Council. Maybe one? And I like more Drakes. Humans&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Say what you will, but Lism’s right about Humans. And I mean, Klbkch is Klbkch, but <em>historically</em>, those Ants&#8230;”</p>
<p>They broke up, backing away from Krshia’s party. The same Drakes who’d cheered her yesterday. Selys desperately went after them.</p>
<p>“No, wait! That’s not fair! Let me talk to Zevara! Don’t spread that! Krshia—”</p>
<p>She turned to look at the Gnoll. Krshia’s shoulders were hunched. She was staring at Lism with her teeth bared. Selys slowly backed up.</p>
<p>“We can win this. Everyone just stay calm. We need to think up a rebuttal for Lism. Talk to Klbkch. Get Erin in on this—”</p>
<p>Elirr and Beilmark nodded. They grabbed Krshia before she could, say, pounce on Lism. Selys was trying to usher Krshia back from the smug Drake when she saw him, standing across from her on the other side of the crowd.</p>
<p>His head was ducked, and he was looking down. But his blue scales were telltale. And he had a sheaf of papers in one hand. Olesm Swifttail was flicking through them, nodding as he listened to Lism speak.</p>
<p>Oh, spin and spin. Sudden changes and betrayals and the fickle nature of the crowd. That was politics. Selys felt the world which seemed so solid, turn to jelly around her. And then she saw what Olesm was holding. The papers. His <em>notes. </em></p>
<p>Selys saw them and the world went red. She didn’t know what possessed her to push through the crowd. And she didn’t catch herself until she was right in front of Olesm, throwing her detailed notes in his face and punching at him with a claw as he tried to block. But a dozen hands caught her, dragging her back, and Gnolls and Drakes yanked the people grabbing Selys off her.</p>
<p>And then both sides were shoving, jostling, shouting—and then someone threw a punch. And both sides erupted into a brawl and Selys and Olesm were caught in the middle of it. Zevara shouted for order and roared for her City Watch while Krshia and Lism looked on, shouting insults at each other. Selys threw punches and tried to push out of the sudden riot as Lism’s supporters clashed with Krshia’s.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, suddenly, it looked like it was an even fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liscor heaved. It turned. It fought amongst itself. And all the momentum Krshia Silverfang had worked for was snatched up, converted, and turned on her in an instant. A classic reversal in chess. Or perhaps Go was a more fitting metaphor?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it was messy. And dirty. And when a despairing and scratched-up Selys walked into the inn, in tears, while Krshia shouted at Lism on the streets and Zevara sat in her office and <em>thought</em>, the scales were even. Or perhaps slanted in Lism’s favor. He had more than enough scales already.</p>
<p>And there they lay. Right up until the [Innkeeper], a young woman named Erin Solstice, came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands. She listened to Selys. She heard about Olesm. She dropped the towel. Slowly, Erin picked it up off the floor. She looked at Selys, around at her inn, her patrons. She thought of Krshia. Erin Solstice looked out at Liscor and made a fist.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is <em>on.</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi! I&#8217;m back! And I wrote a long chapter!</p>
<p>Nothing has changed. Everything has changed. I had a 10-day break and honestly, I could have used a month off. But this is good. I do feel refreshed. Although I&#8217;ll say that I had to cut a good bit from the end of this chapter&#8211;it happens. The first chapter back&#8217;s tough to get into the flow, but I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re back in business. And on my break, I did a few things. I&#8217;m going to try and release Volume 2 soon&#8211;with more editing, but I can now tell you that the cover art for Volume 2 is DONE. And it&#8217;s gorgeous. I&#8217;ll get on that soon, maybe give you Patreons on the higher tiers a peek. But I have even more important news, in a sense.</p>
<p>I have bought a truly ergonomic, weird keyboard. The Kinesis 2, designed for maximum hand-stresslessness. That&#8217;s a word now. It looks weird, I don&#8217;t know how to use it quite right, but it should, apparently, make typing so much easier on my hands. And I think I need it. I&#8217;ll have to learn to use it, but after the next chapter, I&#8217;ll try to write everything with it.</p>
<p>So enjoy me learning a new way to type! If all goes well, I&#8217;ll be able to reduce the hand pain I keep moaning about. I have an ergonomic keyboard (support for hands, better shape), but this is a truly designed keyboard. We&#8217;ll see what it does. For now, hope you enjoy this quiet return to the story! Thanks for reading and look forwards to Erin shenanigans next chapter! We&#8217;re back!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for writing! Political excitiment can be as fun as the violent kind too!</p>
<p>I legit hope the group realizes they insulted Olsem and make up for it, rather than perpetuate a needless interpersonal-conflict. It seems like Olsem wanted to hang out with the group again; I like it when this group all gets along.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>There is something that had been bothering me for a while.</p>
<p>In Ch 6.28, Pisces went to Pallass with Olesm to help him, and it was said that they were going to stay in Pallass the night.</p>
<p>In Interlude &#8211; Embria, it was stated that &#8220;Olesm got back with Pisces from a night in Pallass and an adventure involving a [Librarian]&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in this Chapter, Ch 6.30, that &#8220;Both Pisces and Olesm had returned from Pallass yesterday, but this was their first full day experiencing the new climate.&#8221; of the election.</p>
<p>What been bothering me is that in Ch 6.29, Pisces was already back in Liscor and saw Krshia ongoing election together with his teammates and then later with Erin, Pawn and his teammates again. All of this when he was supposedly in Pallass helping Olesm.</p>
<p>Now I understand that there may be an appropriate explanation for this like;<br />
Ceria sending an encrypted message to inform him of Krshia election, Pisces than would leave Olesm for a while and see it for himself, then return to Pallass to continue to help Olesm, but would not tell him anything about the election.</p>
<p>If it went something like that than Pisces being there in Liscor in Ch 6.29 would make sense. The problem is that it was never stated or explained in any form of why he was there when as stated above he was supposedly in Pallass helping Olesm. This is what has been bothering me as it is close to an Inconsistency. So yes I made a conjecture to explain of how Pisces could have been there, but I feel that You should have stated something along those lines in the first place in Ch 6.29, and if not there than in the following chapters.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>What has Olesm become? He has valid concerns; in case you forgot, the Antinium were planning to allow Veltras to annex the city so that they could reclaim it for themselves afterward. Also, more recently we found out that Klbkch has been using a skill to make people trust him. I’m not saying Lism is a good guy, but the new campaign plan he has is perfectly reasonable. Our most favorite author has masterfully made this a thought provoking election which could go either way. </p>
<p>If the characters were removed from the equation, you’d probably have a difficult time choosing a side.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>The Liscor Antinium&#8217;s plans were at least in part effected by the human army size + the other Queens who don&#8217;t really care much about Liscor or people in general.  </p>
<p>The Liscor Antinium seem to actually want to work with the city and are at least open to accepting the various races as worthy and interesting.  Olesm doesn&#8217;t believe that is possible at all though and is assuming the worst essentially.  He is sort&#8217;ve right about the other Queens of course but that doesn&#8217;t matter to the issue either.</p>
<p>The skill Klbch has been using is nothing special nor particularly unusual or inherently deceitful either.  Especially since he is using it to try and take the edge of decades of fear and racism when trying to talk to people too.  Any human or drake [Diplomat] can also use it too.  And various other classes have skills like it (ie. [Merchants]) that can influence others as well.</p>
<p>Olesm has essentially abandoned rational judgement in favor of what is at best blind fear and at worst racism while backing people he knows to be bad so yeah its totally fair to say he has changed for the worst and to dislike him for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the characters were removed from the equation, you’d probably have a difficult time choosing a side.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I was totally ignorant and didn&#8217;t know anything about the situation at all sure it&#8217;d be difficult but then that would be true no matter what.  You can say that about anything really.  That alone won&#8217;t necessarily mean its good or bad or interesting.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not totally ignorant and there is plenty of information to go on not just about the main characters but also side stories and history of many of those involved so there is plenty of stuff go on here and form a judgement.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Sorry for namecalling, but I think YOU are the one who has abandoned rational judgement. As a comment below already mentioned, the Antinium have their own plans for the city, which surfaced barely during end of the last volume, and the only reason some of them even had a bit of reticence to carry it was because of Erin and only Erin.</p>
<p>History also doesn&#8217;t help their cause. Speaking of the known history of that world, try imagining how the serial would be if there was no POV chapter exclusively from the Antinium. Every major event with the Antinium would owe itself indirectly and directly to Erin. We, as readers, would only know about their general secrecy and about Erin&#8217;s Erinity which managed to change a few, but generalizations are something I abhor. Even Lism, with all the prick he is, has more to him than Laken, which I respect in him as a character (I still dislike him, though less than Laken, but that is that and this is this).</p>
<p>&#8220;But we’re not totally ignorant&#8221;<br />
I agree with you completely. WE are not totally ignorant, which doesn&#8217;t mean the characters themselves are ignorant of events we are privy to because of our readers privilege (Führer Laken, anyone?)</p>
<p>Also, I have a separate issue with one point you made.<br />
&#8220;The skill Klbch has been using is nothing special&#8221;<br />
Victor Lustig and many others would like a word with you. You either don&#8217;t know or understimate how very useful an unconscious sense of trust is. Or the effect of charisma in people. Especially when it&#8217;s used by people with personal agendas, regardless of content.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;As a comment below already mentioned, the Antinium have their own plans for the city,&#8221;<br />
Yes I addressed that already in the reply of mine you were replying too.  </p>
<p>&#8220;History also doesn’t help their cause.&#8221;<br />
History goes both ways.  </p>
<p>While there is certainly some pretty nasty history of horrible wars with the Antinium there is also a history of years of peace with Liscor&#8217;s Antinium as well as the Liscor Antinium&#8217;s recent actions in the Human attack and various other recent attacks too.   Why would you think Olesm gets to ignore that and then still claim he retains his rationality here?</p>
<p>&#8220;which doesn’t mean the characters themselves are ignorant of events we are privy to because of our readers privilege&#8221;<br />
I think even if you want to ignore the information that would only be accessible to the readers than its reasonable to say Olesm is clearly in the wrong here.  I mean even characters in story, who know as much or more as Olesm does about what the Antinium do in story (Zevara, the watch captain), disagree with him for good reasons that were articulated quite clearly in story too you know.  Why are you ignoring, or downplaying, or not considering that at all?</p>
<p>Even if you do want to ignore the reasons Zevara gave in story its pretty clear cut and obvious Olesm is just reacting out of fear and has chosen to back someone who isn&#8217;t honest and is a racist to accomplish his ends.  Those aren&#8217;t the actions of someone who is being good or reasonable.  </p>
<p>Who knows he might change or learn a lesson or 2 about backing crappy people but right now he is definitely not acting like a good person at all.</p>
<p>And as a reader its perfectly legit to consider all the information given to us and judge accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Victor Lustig and many others would like a word with you.&#8221;<br />
Every single merchant is using their charisma and trust influencing skills daily in Liscor to get people to spend more money than they normally would.  Klbkch using his to get people to hate him a bit less is small potatoes at best in the grand scheme of things and is ultimately no worse than any of them.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>To be fair, there is a lot more to Larken criticism than just his one time use of chemical weapon. You might want to refer to previous chapters discussions for a more exhaustive list but on the top of my head :</p>
<p>&#8211; Of all innovations he could have brought this world he chose to sell the way to make siege weapons (exploiting a technicality to get out of his promise to Magnolia not to sell trebuchets).</p>
<p>&#8211; His whole unseen empire is creepy as hell and reeks of surveillance state (he even spies in people&#8217;s bedrooms).</p>
<p>&#8211; Choosing to follow Tyrion&#8217;s army on their genocidal crusade against both goblins and drakes (even if you argue he was somewhat compelled it&#8217;s still cowardly).</p>
<p>And all of that is amplified by the fact that coming from our world (and being of german descent doesn&#8217;t help either), he should know better.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>What Olesm has become? He is trying to have his country not completely at the mercy of a foreign power. In this world (and for most of our real world history) it is only logical. And said foreign power is currently fighting a low-intensity war against the Drakes. Even if the Free Antinium have proved to be allies, the others Hives have proved to be ennemis. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Olesm&#8217;s proposal would be better for the Liscorian population, who really need the work more than the Antinium.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>His country is already effectively at the mercy of a foreign power though and he knows it.  </p>
<p>The Liscor Antinium aren&#8217;t doing the fighting, that is other Antinium.  And as Zevara that situation isn&#8217;t any different than the way Drakes and Humans keep attacking each other.  Which he just brushed off.</p>
<p>Krsha&#8217;s proposal would see everyone get more work too.  Having the Antinium do much of the building just allows them to get it done cheaply with local financing and labor.</p>
<p>And even Olesm knows what he is doing is wrong on some level.  He is acting out of fear and that pretty much never turns out well.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Yes, his country is somewhat at the mercy of a foreign power, and he wants to change it. Is it so bad, to not be at the beck and call of unknown monstrosities best known for coming from nowhere and launching a full scale genocidal war without warning? Yeah, sure they are tame now, but why and for how long? There are no answers for this, not even for us, readers.</p>
<p>And the situation is not different from Humans and Drakes skirmishing &#8211; except that Free Antinium are directly subordinate to Grand Queen, who, as clearly seen, is not for the peace with Drakes at all, or anyone for that matter. Wipe out a continent and turn it into monstrous Hive is still an idea that has clear majority in Antinium politics. If Free Antinium had renounced other Hives for prosecuting war and stated it&#8217;s own independence, as a fucking gesture of a good will, it may be different. But it will never actually make a move that shows trust. Antinium do not trust Drakes &#8211; and you ask Drakes to trust them. And why?</p>
<p>&#8220;Krsha’s proposal would see everyone get more work too. Having the Antinium do much of the building just allows them to get it done cheaply with local financing and labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic case of using immigrants for cheap labor, while slowly strangling your own economy. It&#8217;s eerie how realistic it is. And the argument can go either way. </p>
<p>Olesm is not against Antinum per se, or for racism. He just understands that it is his duty to prepare for a worst case scenario, when noone else would. And sometims it means doing ugly sacrifices of your concience. And sometimes the situation you prepared did not come to pass. But sometimes it does.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>My problem here is that, while yes a good majority of the Anthinium still want to take over Izril, it&#8217;s only because to them that is the most pragmatic option for them, they don&#8217;t come from here and they need to build up thier forces to go fight a litteral god, they are either incapable or unwilling to do it any other way simply because they have never been SHOWN another way, at tthe end of the day they are Insects, and to an inscet surivial is king above all, they aren&#8217;t emotionaly beings, atleast the old antinum aren&#8217;t, from the sounds of it they were all a hive mind with very few personalitys among them</p>
<p>but at the same time, if they are never given the chance or opitunity to try another way, then they won&#8217;t ever change like the Free Hive has, if no one is willing to take a chance at peace, it can never be an eventuality</p>
<p>some people see that (erin, krista and the like) but people like Lism and Oslem are just like the racists from our world, they don&#8217;t want change, or they fear it, so they violently reject it dispite all evidence to the contrary</p>
<p>I get that Oslem is scared of the Antinium, and he has every right to be, the Antinium wars were horrific, but he is quite litteraly ignoring all evidence that says the antinium are changing because he&#8217;s scared at the posibility that they MIGHT take over, but if they were going to do that why not do it in the decade that liscor has hosted them?</p>
<p>Why wait this long for any reason other then the fact that they truly do want peace between drakes and antinum</p>
<p>and yea the other hives aren&#8217;t of the same mind, YET, but they will in time, and again, if no one is willing to try, then peace can never be achieved</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Pirateaba, I most humbly disagree that lemonade is one of the most popular drinks in the world. In our country, we only use lemons for recipes (e.g. cheesecake) because lemon is not endemic here. Thus, we only know lemonade from movies. (We do have a citrus equivalent and its corresponding juice.)</p>
<p>Also, since the top 2 populations in the world are China and India (with US being a distant 3rd), majority of the world&#8217;s population are Asians. Tea and its variations (iced tea, milk tea) should be way more popular than lemonade, I think.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Oddly enough Lism managed to make a good speaker after Olesm had set him straight. Once you remove the grudge, tone down the racism, and focus on why there needs to be a change in the city&#8230; He picked out the troubling rise  in rent, focused on those who became unemployed by the ants, and brought up good counter arguments in keeping the army while also having the support the city in means of trade.</p>
<p>Yes Olesm helped give the proper lines and helped get some extra funds&#8230; But Lism actually put enough effort into it selling the deal and having people see him in how he tried to help and take care of Olesm instead of doing something stupid like he had done before.</p>
<p>He may be a prick&#8230; But I have to give him credit for setting most of it aside for what he believes is right for the city. Human leaders might not be trusted in his book, but trade is needed and useful. He may curse the crazy human, but he understands the door is important and he did focus on the issues of jobs and he actually sounded halfway descent and respectable when went with building the city with their own two claws&#8230; Or paws.</p>
<p>Still they are new to this game and Erin? She hears speeches and political parties once every four years including ideas they never thought possible.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Well its not really clear to me Lism set aside his distrust and/or racism.</p>
<p>To me it looks like he just used Olesm&#8217;s clever advice to repackage and re-represent it to the population in a more favorable manner to the naive and inexperienced people.  </p>
<p>The modern term is &#8216;dog whistle politics&#8217; (google Barry Goldwater for some interesting history of it) though I don&#8217;t know if Erin would be familiar with the term I&#8217;d be she would instinctually grasp the dishonesty of it.</p>

Before, his stance was &#8220;no elections, no policy changes, The Council Knows Best&#8221;, now he&#8217;s proposed an expansion to Liscor that&#8217;s similar to Krshia&#8217;s.

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Yeah those changes in policy, as well as the accompanying propaganda, are what i mean by a repackaging.  The source of the funding + his reasons for using Drakes only are the continued racism.  The man himself hasn&#8217;t changed nor has his end goals of trying to preserve the social and political status quo.  He just changed the means.</p>
<p>He isn&#8217;t shouting the racist part loudly anymore but its still inherently implied and the end effects would be largely the same for the non-Drake population of Liscor if the election had never happened.  A real world example would the US&#8217;s War on Drugs and its effects which just so happened to predominately effect non-Whites in a highly negative manner.   </p>
<p>The War on Drugs was also a drastic change in policy but the end net effect was to essentially continue the various social and legal suppression of non-Whites that had existed under Jim Crow laws.</p>

This is a meaningless platitude that can and has been used to justify all kinds of terrible policies though.</p>
<p>The big give away that what he is doing is wrong is the person who he has chosen to back to accomplish his goals.  Lism is the sort of person you couldn&#8217;t trust to run a fast food restaurant.  You definitely wouldn&#8217;t want him running the city.</p>

<p>So not only did he change the other candidate&#8217;s views to one he could support,  he did so by incorporating the good ideas Krshia had in a way he could accept, thus resulting in the best of both worlds for the Liscor he wants.</p>

<p>Which everyone seems to know, and even Olesm acknowledges is prooooobably true, but doesn&#8217;t like to admit to.  Olesm just thinks there is a slim chance that maybe they&#8217;d be able to beat the Antinium back now if they attacked and wants to try and hold on to that sliver of hope.</p>
<p>That BS + the whole backing the lying racist family member (who he knows is fundamentally wrong but backs anyways) is why he is getting some hate.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Why are you ignoring and/or downplaying the 1st sentence in that quote?</p>
<p>When you read it what exactly do you think it means?  Does it really sound all that confident to you?</p>
<p>Yes he says there is a decent chance in the next sentence but I read that as him trying to rationalize the situation.  Which makes a lot of sense given his fear about the Antinium.  </p>
<p>After all if there really was a decent chance current methods and stopgaps could stop the Antinium as is why would he be so afraid of allowing their forces to grow (remember, the guard is supposed to be getting more funding for more people, they&#8217;re not just building walls) at all?  It would just be a continuation of the current status quo militarily speaking.</p>
<p>If you actually think about what he is saying instead of taking his words at face value you&#8217;ll realize it doesn&#8217;t make much sense.  Remember he may be a expert but he is also just as much of a person as anyone else in story.</p>
<p>And Zevara is just as knowledgeable about the Antinium as well as their own forces and the likely outcome of a conflict between the 2 as well.  There is a reason why she is disagreeing with him and it makes no real sense to dismiss her read on the situation.  Its not like she is some new recruit or half wit.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>its like we read a completely different storyries<br />
the start of the setnece and what I quoted don&#8217;t conflict at all, they are completely in line.</p>
<p>“The Antinium have always been able to overwhelm Liscor, Watch Captain. At any moment, if their Queen orders it, they could storm the city and I would give them the odds of winning. The only thing that saves us is that it is not advantageous for the Antinium to do so. And the fact that there is a chance, a decent chance, that any sudden attack would fail, due to the safeguards we have in place. If we give them more concessions, like having six hundred Soldiers aboveground at any moment…the odds begin to favor the Antinium more and more. If we give them an incentive, the Free Queen—no, the Grand Queen might decide—”&#8221; </p>
<p>translation of how I read it: yes if they attack they have a good chance to win if they storm it right now, but not only they have little to benefit, while the odds are in their favor, the safeguards that we have we still have a chance to hold out and that possiblity acts as a deterrent, giving them better odds might incentive them to act.</p>
<p>none of the statement is overly confident, or too scared, he believes that the safeguards gives them a chance, and zevara is even more confident in them thats why she says </p>
<p>“Even so, we’ve always known the Hive was large. They’ve always outnumbered the City Watch. That’s why we have safeguards in place.” </p>
<p>so there is some confidence in it all around, but zevara isn&#8217;t a tactician, or a strategist, she&#8217;s a head guardswomen, a mix of fighting, civil duty, and leading.<br />
thats why the highest strategist or tactician of the highest level has his place of authority.  </p>
<p>cause both you and zevara seemed to forget, why wouldn&#8217;t expanding the guards work to combat the expanding hive?</p>
<p>“The Antinium are far, far more efficient than Drakes, Humans, or any other species in the world in terms of space. If Liscor expands, the Antinium will gain two Workers or Soldiers for every new person we can house. And they are all potential combatants.”</p>
<p>the hive gets way more for any space given, the guards need to be trained, hired and paid, and even then they can only be a fraction of the population as a fighting force.</p>
<p>not to mention letting them have more legs on the ground gives them far more power in any surprise attack.</p>
<p>there&#8217;s a reason why zevara in the end fell down to the argument about trusting klb instead of pushing any strategic argument further against olesn, she&#8217;s out of her depth and she knows that she can&#8217;t out argue him.</p>
<p>to me everything you said was already fully countered by olesm in story, and the only thing you have is doubting his judgement by saying he is afraid of the antinium, which I also doubt, he isn&#8217;t afraid of antinium, he hangs around with plenty of antinium individuals, he is wary and cautious of them as a collective, because he knows that the antinium queens are the ones in command and he doesn&#8217;t know or trust them &#8220;you are all dust&#8221; statement by klb didn&#8217;t help trusting him either</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;they are completely in line&#8221;<br />
Nope, they&#8217;re complete opposites!!  </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t both believe there is a &#8220;decent chance&#8221; at winning AND believe at the same time that the only thing stopping you from getting crushed is that it isn&#8217;t worth the enemies time or effort!!</p>
<p>The contradiction is obvious when you actually try and analyze what he is saying.  You&#8217;re just taking everything he is saying at face value and are essentially viewing his assessment is perfect and without flaw.  </p>
<p>&#8220;translation of how I read it&#8221;<br />
Even if you want to read it that way that is still a losing argument.  </p>
<p>He is talking about, AT BEST, a delaying action!!  And only as a potential deterrent too!!  If your best hope in battle is to lose slowly than how is that a sensible or winning strategy?  </p>
<p>By default he is admitting the status quo is untenable&#8230;yet he fears a change in the situation where the Antinium might win&#8230;. when he is admitting they&#8217;ll win if they attack anyways right then??  </p>
<p>That is reason to you?  You don&#8217;t see a contradiction there??  And you really think if that is the best strategy he can come up with given the current circumstances that his opinion is beyond reproach?</p>
<p>&#8220;cause both you and zevara seemed to forget, why wouldn’t expanding the guards work to combat the expanding hive?&#8221;<br />
Neither I nor Zevara forgot.  And Zevara is already aware of whatever strategies the city has in place in case the hive attacks too you know.  She has to know that to do her job of defending the city in case the hive attacks.  </p>
<p>Zevara essentially said that Olesm&#8217;s point is moot because the hive can already take over the city if they wanted to.  Given the hive&#8217;s recent actions + their lack of attempts to take over the city already there is good reason to give them some benefit of the doubt.  </p>
<p>&#8220;the hive gets way more for any space given&#8221;<br />
Of course.  But they already know they&#8217;re ALREADY drastically outnumbered and will, AT BEST, lose slowly in a combat situation.</p>
<p>If you know that you&#8217;ll already lose a fight why does it make sense to worry about losing the fight?  Especially when your opponent has shown they can be a real ally instead?  </p>
<p>If you convert your opponents into allies don&#8217;t you win the fight before it ever starts?  Or is that sort of thinking totally untenable to you?</p>
<p>Sure it seems untenable to Olesm&#8230;.but Olesm is essentially ignoring recent events with the Antinium and has resorted to backing people who he knows who are in the wrong to achieve his own ends.  The guy is pretty far from infallible you know that right?</p>
<p>&#8220;there’s a reason why zevara in the end fell down to the argument about trusting klb instead of pushing any strategic argument further against olesn&#8221;<br />
Sure, cuz&#8217; its an emotional argument saying that her judgement might be compromised.</p>
<p>Once someone starts lobbing comments like that at you the discussion over because they&#8217;re essentially saying they won&#8217;t really trust you no matter what.</p>
<p>Words won&#8217;t get through to them at that point.  At least not from you.  Words from someone else they trust MIIIIIIIIGHT change their mind but even then its a long shot.  It really comes down to action at that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;to me everything you said was already fully countered by olesm in story&#8221;<br />
No no, you&#8217;re not analyzing what he is saying.  Its mostly contradictory if you evaluate it properly so its not really a counter at all.  Stop assessing at face value and stop treating his comments as gospel.  He is as prone to mistakes as anyone else in story, really he is.  </p>
<p>Just look at how he threw the goblins who died defending his city under the bus to score some cheap political points with others to solicit them for money:  those aren&#8217;t the actions of a good or reasonable person.</p>
<p>He is fine with individual Antinium but he is quite obviously scared of the Hive and the Hive is what he is trying to work against here.  Don&#8217;t go confusing the 2, they&#8217;re not the same.  Just like you might be ok with an individual from a certain country and not blame them for their country&#8217;s actions you can still quite reasonably blame the country&#8217;s govt. and fear that govt.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>to me you are over analyzing  and adding things that are directly contridictory to the story just to fit your narrative against olesm, I read your analysis, and most of it is invented in your own head (example:he didn&#8217;t talk about delaying action at all, where the fuck did you get that? he talked about the ATTACK FAILING, the stop gap being delaying tactic is your insertion )</p>
<p>or this nonsense:<br />
 &#8220;You can’t both believe there is a<br />
“decent chance” at winning AND believe at the same time that the only thing stopping you from getting crushed is that it isn’t worth the enemies time or effort!!&#8221; </p>
<p> thats not what he said, he said that they aren&#8217;t attacking both because its not worth the effort AND there&#8217;s a chance (lesser chance, think 30-40% vs 70-60%) that liscor will win in the current state (and zevara believes it too cause she brought up the safeguards first so stop saying its just olesm)</p>
<p>its like we are reading completely different stories, and half of what you said is completely contradictory to the text.</p>
<p>but I don&#8217;t feel like arguing here, its too cumbersome, and I won&#8217;t continue this discussion, I think you are wrong and you twist things in the story to fit your own narrative, with either biased over anaylsis and complete changing of what is written.</p>
<p>if you want discussion with me go to the discord, this is way to cumbersome to me.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I hate to say it, but I would probably vote for Lism at this point.  As much as many of the local antinium would like peace, they are clearly still a threat, and Liscor would be taking a big risk in giving them more concessions, and I&#8217;m saying this as a reader, knowing much more than the citizens of Liscor.  If I was in their position, there is no way I would vote for Krshia at this point, despite her being a better person.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>But of course Erin is going to support Krshia, because all of her experiences with the Antinium have been positive and even discounting the facade she often wears, she is still extremely naive about the politics of the situation, especially in regards to the Antinium.  I really think everyone is giving Olesm too hard of a time, both in the story and out.  He&#8217;s doing what he thinks is right, and he&#8217;s one of Erin&#8217;s friends too.  I just hate that unless you&#8217;re planning a twist in the next chapter, Erin will be taking sides against her friend, especially right after they managed to repair the rift caused by the Battle of Liscor.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Well, the Antinium do pose a risk. But if you&#8217;ve read the antinium chapters, particularly the ones with Klbckh, you&#8217;d know that the antinium have a near zero chance of invading. It just goes against all of their interests. One of the primary purposes of the deal was to try and convince the other antinium that peace is an option. Trying to get more antinium in the watch was an effort to try and promote better relations. If it were any other hive, than you would be absolutely correct. Furthermore, the local antinium desire peace, and you say they are still a threat. But if it got to the point where war was declared anyways? Well then this treaty would still be insignificant, because the whole Drake civilization would already be under siege, and liscor would already be dead in the water. Krisha winning is quite possibly the most effective way to get the other antinium to not declare war. And if nothing else happens, war is a certainty.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d go <i>quite</i> so far as to vote for Lism (I question the longer-term viability of his plans; trade with Humans offers more competitive advantages than trade with the Drakes and is easier to expand, future investment is easier to secure from the Antinium than the Walled Cities, and receiving a favor like this from the Walled Cities hurts their political positions in ways more likely to be called in later), but I would definitely call for a renegotiation of the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Specifically, the diplomatic provisions &#8211; the right to invite members of other hives without further restrictions is simply too much, when said hives are pretty much open enemies to the Drakes. If it were modified to include noticing the Watch in advance of such invitations, as well as permitting the Watch to assign a minder and the right to revoke the invitation should it be deemed necessary, that would still allow the hive to work towards their stated goal of peace (and their actual goal of going to Erin&#8217;s inn) while mitigating the possible dangers &#8211; or at least letting the Watch <i>know</i> when something suspicious happens.</p>
<p>As for the rest&#8230; Well, honestly, the development of Individuals (and their less-enlightened subsets) probably broke the balance of power far more than expanding the hives or putting more soldiers on the surface ever could. If the only consideration is security, I don&#8217;t think it mattes much at this point.</p>
<p>But now that Lism actually <i>has</i> a plan&#8230; I think he&#8217;d be a viable option. A total jerk with a bad history whose objectivity I would doubt, but I&#8217;d at least expect the city to be expanded and the Watch funded.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>So basically, now there are two active political factions.</p>
<p>Both propose essentially the same plan, with single twist: whom from to borrow the money and favors from: from Antimium, or from Drakes.</p>
<p>One party was creative, inventing new possibilities where second, reactive, could not see any.</p>
<p>Second party stole idea of first and slightly repurposed it.</p>
<p>I feel a bit doubtful about capabilities of pro-Lism&#8217;s party.</p>
<p>Liscor will be through oceans of monsters and nightmares; so they need someone capable.</p>
<p>I wonder which angle would Erin choose. Cause she seems like she&#8217;s motivated to help her friends. Also take Lism down a notch.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>The biggest issue with Krshia&#8217;s proposals would be the huge number of concessions towards the Antinium. People were willing to have that, but they were all uneasy (even Krshia&#8217;s party) at how much the city had to give way to get what they wanted. Basically, the change was much too big for the people to be fully comfortable with it.</p>
<p>I think things would have been totally different if only Zevara consulted someone before negotiating with Kblkch. Olesm might still be immature for a [Strategist], but he can point out weaknesses and improve the deal between the Antinium and Krshia&#8217;s party. Even Kblkch thought that Krshia winning was already good enough for them. Of course, giving out money just for Krshia to win would place the Free Antinium in a weaker position because of how it would look like to the people of the city (will give lots of moolah for a tiny concession). Nevertheless, Olesm would have been in on it, the concessions would be small enough for the city to swallow comfortably, Zevara was able to ask for Olesm&#8217;s help (possible +romance points?), and Krshia&#8217;s stance would&#8217;ve been much more solid, leaving Lism with little to counter (Olesm could&#8217;ve convinced him since he would have ironed the kinks of the Antinium deal).</p>
<p>(I also have an issue with a council that has as much Gnolls as Drakes. Personally, I&#8217;m all for it; however Liscor would look weak to the other Drake cities this way. It would be branded as the Drake city that let itself be overrun by Gnolls and Antinium. It would no longer be a Drake city, which would probably make it a threat that needs to be neutralized.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Erin way is much more chaotic and fun, so I&#8217;m all for it. However, I hope people don&#8217;t harp on Olesm too much. I mean, the people you know and respect are all ganging up on another person you love, directly in your face? It&#8217;s scary to stand up for just one person against the many. They&#8217;re making Lism to be an all-out bad guy, instead of a fear-driven but still patriotic citizen. What kind of nephew would he be, especially given the fact that Lism raised him, if he didn&#8217;t stand up to that? Also, when he talked to Zevara, he didn&#8217;t argue for his uncle; rather, he stuck to the pressing issue at hand &#8211; the Antinium. Don&#8217;t take what he Olesm said as racism or undue hate against the Antinium; think of it as his way of protecting Liscor against possible threats. Like it or not, the Antinium are a threat because they do not have Liscor&#8217;s interests as the highest priority, yet they are in the immediate vicinity of Liscor and are able to initiate any hostile actions if the Hive needs it. They most probably will never have to, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that they are willing to do so if needed. Personally, knowing what I know of Kblkch, I&#8217;m all for a blended multiracial Drake city of Drakes, Gnolls, Antinium and other races like Humans. Nevertheless, this kind of thing needs time, so it&#8217;s okay for me for Olesm to back the other party. I mean, really? Just because they&#8217;re all friends he has to side with Krshia? He&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s thinking more of the long-term effects than anybody else (Krshia&#8217;s angling for change and power, Selys is just looking to use her abilities for something, Zevara is all for the Watch Guard, Erin is just jumping the bandwagon, etc.), I think, except for Pisces.</p>
<p>Ocean23 mentioned some inconsistencies in the timing of Pisces&#8217; return to Liscor. In this chapter, Pisces&#8217; opinion regarding the elections was interrupted. All of these makes me think that Pisces has a possible hand in all the election shenanigans. If so, I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s gonna happen next!</p>
<p>On another note, I wish Pirateaba would also write about how the Free Antinium treaty came to be because I&#8217;m still amazed both by the fact that it was made while there&#8217;s ongoing battles with other Antinium and that it&#8217;s been preserved all this time by Liscor with nary a problem.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;Really? Just because they’re all friends he has to side with Krshia?&#8221;<br />
I didn&#8217;t read it as that at all.  Its more like, &#8220;that Lism guy is clearly a huge scumbag doing scummy things and even if you love him you shouldn&#8217;t back him on this&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Olesm was really trying to think in the long term either.  He is mostly motivated by fear of the Antinium.  He was largely fine with Krsha&#8217;s proposals so long as it wasn&#8217;t going to see the Antinium benefit is all.  That was his whole issue with everything period.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I think Erin will use few directions of attack. Overloading Olesm &#8211; (1). Talking with Klkbch and Zevara to appraise their usefulness and willingness to see things through &#8211; (2). Leverage [Gossip Monger] to explain why Krshia is idealogically better than Lism&#8217;s party &#8211; (3).  Debates under truth spells (with Klkbch included) &#8211; (4). Drop the [Princess] to buff campaign &#8211; (5). Architect scandal that explores Liam&#8217;s rudeness &#8211; (6).</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Hooray!  Erin is back!<br />
While I understand why Erin needed 30 chapters to recharge after the end of book 5, It&#8217;s  been strange to see her so passive and I&#8217;ve been waiting for her to regain her forward momentum.  It was a great cliff hanger to see her suddenly engaged again.</p>
<p>Olesm, Olesm, Olesm.  You may have the class of [Strategist], but you&#8217;re still a tactician.  The end of Chapter 5 and now 6 shows Olesms weaknesses, he&#8217;s an inside the box thinker.  He doesn&#8217;t look at the entire situation and think long term.  </p>
<p>In this case, the goal is to prevent the Antinium from destroying Liscor.  Does Olesm&#8217;s actions reduce this possibility?  I&#8217;d say no.  They couldn&#8217;t stop it right now, they couldn&#8217;t stop it if the hive expanded.  The only way for the Antinium to be stopped from destroying Liscor is to make sure they don&#8217;t want to do so.  So integrating them is a good way to do that.  </p>
<p>I also liked Olesms help of Lism.  It&#8217;s easy to forgive a horrible racist when it&#8217;s not you being hurt by them and they love you.  It&#8217;s nice to see that Lism is not entirely bad and he dotes on his nephew.  It gives him more dimension.  Though Lism still is a horrible small minded person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping this arc will have Olesm take a good hard look at himself.  Yes, he&#8217;s prodigy and good at his job, but the position of Liscors [Strategist] is currently filled by a human [Innkeeper].  In some ways that&#8217;s ok, not everyone is a genius, but Olesm needs to start trying to improve himself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still hilarious though that Liscor&#8217;s ultimate move is,</p>
<p>[Summon Erin]</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;If Olesm really believes the Antinium have the favored odds in winning such a fight than its a given that any safeguards would be a delaying action. He doesn’t have to actually literally say the words.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is not a given at all though. An antium hive is a hivemind, meaning that killing the queen is a victory condition. If they have contingencies that include a counterattack which could kill the queen, that is not a delaying action.</p>
<p>Also, just because the odds are in the antiums favour, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Liscors contingencies are worthless in a game theory standoff such as this. Let us assign costs and probabilities to the possible outcomes, from the antiums point of view. Note that the antiums point of view is the only one that matters here, because they are the faction choosing whether to initiate an attack. So the actual probability of Liscors contingencies working out does not actually factor into this calculation, only what the antium think they are.</p>
<p>Let us say that the antium think that currently there is a 30% risk that an attack fails and the queen is killed. They assign this outcome a value of -10000, because loosing a queen is currently a disaster for the antium. Conversely, there is a 70% chance that the attack succeeds and they take the city. Let us assign this outcome a value of 2000 for the antium. Taking a city is valuable strategically, but it can be recaptured later and destroys any goodwill that the free antium has earned with the native races. If we do the math we get this: </p>
<p>Success: 0.7 * 2000 = 1400<br />
Failure: 0.3 * -10000 = -3000</p>
<p>currently we see that the probabilistic cost of the outcomes favour not attacking. Of course, I just made these numbers up. Only the antium can know what probability and value they assign the different outcomes. But from Liscors point of view, keeping contingencies open is very important even if they don&#8217;t assure victory, to make sure that the probabilistic cost of failure is larger than the gain of success for the antium, at least as long the grand queen, which has no love for Liscor, is calling the shots. (Go team Olesm!).</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>OK,  so I&#8217;ve been thinking what would be the best solution for both sides. But in reality there are sort of three sides. Because antinium decisions are made only by important hive members, that means only queens and prognugators! They make this difficult. Before they can get more freedom, Liscor should get some insurance they wont attack them. But what is important for antinium? Again only their queens (and prognugators). As Klbkch said multiple times soldiers and workers are disposable. But we see it is not the case. They can become individuals with empathy and care for other people, even die for them!! This is in contrast with Klbkch decision to protect Erin, which is still mostly logical for the benefit of the hive.</p>
<p>So I believe that Liscor should change its economy. Hive has a lot of money and they want new Individuals. So drakes and gnolls should do what Erin does. Sell them stuff. From food to anything they could want. Not only would this bring more money to gnolls and drakes, it would bring hive and city closer together. Also future Individuals might start to care about Liscor citizens and might refuse order to attack them, if they were ordered. So win win.</p>
<p>Only problem with this is racism.</p>
<p>Second. Queen doesn&#8217;t care for Liscor. Something should be done with that. I don&#8217;t know what.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure Erin can see what&#8217;s happening. It doesn&#8217;t matter who wins when they are all fighting for the same side. Lism accepting aid from other walled cities will give them political clout in Liscor and in the future they can all say &#8220;we paid for your wall&#8221; and thus their Drake and civic duty is done next time liscor needs aid. Why send soldiers when you paid for the wall? Once that&#8217;s come to light lism will need to change his approach or double down and both benefits krshia and the city.</p>

<p>Yes, that seems like you&#8217;ve caught an interesting hidden agenda. Which is believable.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s this thing where if Liscor falls due to any kind of enemies &#8211; monsters, Antimium, Humans, Goblins, all Drakes will lose. So they would still have to send troops anyway. Walled cities are hostages to Liscor&#8217;s strategic position.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>You would have a point&#8230;if it hadn&#8217;t been established already that at least Pallass doesn&#8217;t see it that way. They were intentionally dragging their tails when sending soldiers to Liscor, even though it was clear Liscor would fall without such aid rendered. And if I read the little tidbits in these chapter back then right, Pallass wasn&#8217;t the only one. I think only 2 of the Walled Cities immediately pledged help, Salazsar and one other (I can&#8217;t remember which one). It took Olesm publicly (and worldwide via MageTV) calling them out on it to get them to move. And even then some pallassian senators hired Typhenous to shut down the Portal Door (I don&#8217;t believe it was all senators, but I think it&#8217;s realistic to say that it wasn&#8217;t one single senator either, but a group of them). Liscor didn&#8217;t seem all that important to Pallass&#8217; leadership at that moment.<br />
So pew makes a valid point here. By accepting the Walled Cities&#8217; money Liscor indebts itself to them. And I mean, come on. We&#8217;re talking nobles, politicians and most likely wealthy merchants (at least where the &#8220;private donations&#8221; are concerned) giving out money. Those kinds of people never give out anything, least of all money, for free. And they&#8217;re drakes! We&#8217;ve seen how they get over money. All those people will want something out of this endevour, more than just preventing the Free Antinium from gaining more influence in Liscor. They&#8217;ll probably want favours and that&#8217;s the most dangerous thing to pay with, because you can never say what will be expected of you. It could be anything from passing certain favourable laws to restricting groups of people or encouraging the discrimination thereof. Lobbying will start soon enough, giving cities hundreds of miles away from Liscor the right to meddle in its affairs which wasn&#8217;t really a problem until now.<br />
With any luck Erin will see this, coming from a governing system where such things are common.</p>

<p>The queen though&#8230; have you missed how terrifying she is? And I&#8217;m not only talking about her gruesome apparence but also her haughtiness casual disregard for the lives of her lesser. If anything, Lism and Oselm would gain votes at everyone of her allocutions. Even the individuals are pretty much too &#8220;weird&#8221; to stand any real chance in my opinion&#8230; And it&#8217;s not even about prejudice, just imagine Pawn or Kvmr giving a speech to an audience of gnolls and drakes or worst&#8230; imagine them at a debate.</p>
<p>At this point, i think the only antinium that might stand a chance would be Klbtch or perhaps Yellow Splatters as he seems pretty articulate and charismatic&#8230; and neither seem available for the job.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&gt;I have bought a truly ergonomic, weird keyboard. The Kinesis 2, designed for maximum hand-stresslessness. That’s a word now. It looks weird, I don’t know how to use it quite right</p>
<p>Press both of your right thumbs on Enter and Space simultaneously&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://compote.slate.com/images/68ccad2d-c469-4b6b-849d-75e2381e5270.jpg"><img src="https://compote.slate.com/images/68ccad2d-c469-4b6b-849d-75e2381e5270.jpg" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;joking.</p>
<p>Looked through manuals available on their website&#8230; If it&#8217;s Advantage2, then it seems reasonable. 2 vitual layers; ability to remap keys, then plug it into another computer and still have remapped keys. Most likely you would be interested in remapping caps lock into something usable (escape delete tab shift etc). Remapping app seems to be the most comfy way to go. Things for Power Users seem to be quite targeted on a very niche workflow or when app is not available but you need planning; reprogramming it without app from kb itself might work but it&#8217;s not that observable.</p>
<p>Main thumb keys &#8211; backspace/del/enter/space are another candidate for swapping among themselves &#8211; perhaps space/backspace/del/enter would be more comfortable (or not?)</p>
<p>Regarding amount of physical keys and their placement &#8211; ya, that&#8217;s enough for writing English novel and browsing and for most games.</p>
<p>Regarding it&#8217;s form &#8211; I think this school of thinking where they attempt to tear kb in two &#8220;paws&#8221; is wise (due to wrists). I also think that organizing keys in columns rather than rows makes a lot of sense (due to fingers).</p>
<p>Brain rewiring period is coming&#8230; It always comes if you suddenly change keyboard after you&#8217;ve spent years specializing is one&#8230; It&#8217;s FUN (dwarf fortress type of fun..). Even when old and new keyboards have conventional design, it still happens. Best advice is to use both keyboards during this period &#8211; part of time old, and part of time new.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Good to have you back from your short break pirate.</p>
<p>Now as for the story. It was clear from the beginning of the election arc that things wouldn&#8217;t be so easy as Krishia just winning easily because she&#8217;s the better person and has more &#8220;humane&#8221; and hopeful politics. It just wouldn&#8217;t fit with the current earth politics and politicians that the current arc seems to mirror. Plus, Innworld never has been about things being easy&#8230; victories if they happen are hard to get by, and more often than not, costly or even phyrric.</p>
<p>Still, Lism stealling the whole &#8220;build that wall&#8221; slogan was as predictable (in hindsight) as it just makes sense. I just hope things won&#8217;t go as bad as in our world (well Lism is probably a bit less bad than the politicians he mirrors, despite being an awful racist).</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m hyped for this arc (and for a potential resistance arc if Lism wins or just &#8220;coup d&#8217;état&#8221; after losing.</p>
<p>And yeah, screw Oselm for empowering his racist relative (who should have been drowned and been banished in a special hell with Persua).</p>

This arc has a unique weird charm. Perhaps it&#8217;s a strange association, but somehow it reminds me an old film &#8220;Gangs of New York&#8221; &#8211; especially when it comes to themes of xenophobia and politics.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>He choose siege weapons because it has an immediate utility, and maybe he didn&#8217;t think of something else. And the Innworld is a dangerous world, so introducing weapons is a good idea to defend itself. </p>
<p>His power of seeing evolve because is his blind, and without it he could not protect its people. But yes you&#8217;re right, it is a bit creepy. </p>
<p>Concerning Tyrion, Laken followed him by gratitude for saving himself, Durene and his people. And at first it was supposed only to be a war to destroy the [Goblin Lord]&#8217;s army. When it appears Tyrion&#8217;s goal was Liscor, it was too late to go back as he wanted. And Laken regret it, and saved the life of several goblins (even if it is by making them prisoners), we will see how it unfolds.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I mean those seem to me like rationalizations more than anything.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still someone from Earth who came to Innworld, became a Dictator and embraced the worst Innworld had to offer&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying he doesn&#8217;t have redeeming qualities or that all he did was evil&#8230; But then again, the same can be said from the worst and most ruthless rulers here on earth too.</p>
<p>Rulers tend to be (rightfully) judged by their worst actions and Larken has done pretty awful stuff even by Earth&#8217;s standards. So I&#8217;d forgive those criticizing him.</p>
<p>Still, I know the ball is in the author&#8217;s court and I guess we&#8217;ll see. Most of his &#8220;crimes&#8221; were not done out of malice (some were though like refusing Rag&#8217;s peace offer to avenge his people who died).</p>
<p>All in all, I do think he&#8217;d make an awesome antagonist who&#8217;s not all &#8220;evil&#8221; but is still frankly terrifying.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Seems to me that on a world where &#8220;truth spells&#8221; actually work, it&#8217;d be far more difficult to lie or misdirect the electorate than it is here on Earth. And any politician who refused to submit to a truth spell would automatically be suspect. Unless I missed something, these spells work on all species, so even the intent of the Antinium could be verified.</p>
