		<p>Erin remembered staring down the barrel of a Dragon’s nose. It wasn’t the most glamorous or exciting way of putting it, but that was what had happened.</p>
<p>She’d stepped around the corner, into what she’d thought had been her bathroom, and then there had been a Dragon, larger than life, larger than a house.</p>
<p>Breathing fire.</p>
<p>Erin could only vaguely recall the screaming and panicked rush filled with fire and a roar that sounded almost like a voice before she was out of the cave, running for her life. But she could still remember the moment she’d stared into the Dragon’s swirling blue and violet eyes.</p>
<p>Her heart had stopped. The world had gone silent, and Erin had felt the same sensation that always overtook her when she used the [Immortal Moment] skill now. She had been overwhelmed by his presence.</p>
<p>She felt the same thing now. Lady Magnolia Reinhart was just sitting there. And she was just a woman, not particularly tall or big. But she had a <em>presence</em>.</p>
<p>And then the woman spoke, and the moment passed. But Erin still remembered it.</p>
<p>“Do come sit, Miss Solstice. Or—may I call you Erin? Formal titles are so tiresome, and I gather your people speak somewhat more casually than mine, is that right?”</p>
<p>Your people. Erin blinked as she awkwardly took a seat opposite Lady Magnolia on the couch. She practically sank into it, it was so soft. And comfortable. And cool!</p>
<p>The air was filled with the faint scent of lavender, and the room was cool and pleasant, the perfect temperature to be in. Erin had a terrible desire to just lie down on the sofa and relax, but she couldn’t do that. She scrambled to answer Lady Magnolia’s question instead.</p>
<p>“Um, yes. I mean, we do. Sorry! I can try—”</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it. I find it delightfully quaint. But where <em>are</em> my manners? Do forgive me. I am Magnolia Reinhart. Delighted to make your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“I’m Erin. Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>Magnolia held out a hand and Erin took it. She had the oddest impulse to kiss it as if she were a knight, but perhaps that was because of how elegantly the other woman moved. She had no wasted movements, no hesitation. She was the picture of grace, and good cheer for that matter. Lady Magnolia had a slight smile on her lips and a face naturally given over to laughter and energy.</p>
<p>“I have been terribly anxious to meet you, I must say.”</p>
<p>To Erin’s surprise, Lady Magnolia had a firm handshake. The older woman withdrew her hand and picked up her tea cup and saucer.</p>
<p>“I have tea, if you will share it. Unless you prefer something stronger? A fruit drink, perhaps? I’m afraid I have no coffee and nor do I know of any substance like it as of yet, but do let me know if you desire anything else.”</p>
<p>“What? No. I’m fine. Tea is fine, I mean. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Erin watched as Ressa deftly lifted the steaming pot and filled both cups with a gold-green liquid. It smelled like citrus and tasted like—</p>
<p><em>Limes?</em></p>
<p>Lady Magnolia chuckled at the look on Erin’s face.</p>
<p>“Do excuse me. This is a favorite tea of mine. I find it does wonders for the inattentive mind. But where was I? Ah yes, allow me to welcome you into my household. I apologize for the delay; I was meeting with some rather important people and then of course you had met the young men and women from your world. I would have been remiss to draw you away from that gathering, but now that you are here, would you like to play a game of chess?”</p>
<p>The question came at the crest of a tidal wave of words and hit Erin in the face. She stared at Magnolia for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Um—yes?”</p>
<p>“Wonderful. Ressa?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia clapped her hands in delight. Erin watched as Ressa took something off a shelf—a chess board and pieces, already set up as if it had been prepared ahead of time.</p>
<p>Everything was moving a bit too fast. Erin hesitated as she held the tea cup between her fingers.</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia twinkled at Erin. Almost literally. In the course of a few seconds she’d gone from being a mysterious, almost scary person in Erin’s head to the down-to-earth genteel noble in front of her.</p>
<p>“Well—I just wanted to say thank you for bringing me here. And sending the coach and uh, helping the other people.”</p>
<p>“From your world.”</p>
<p>“Um. Yes?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia chuckled again at the expression on Erin’s face.</p>
<p>“<span style="color:#feedff;">Don’t look so alarmed, my dear. Please, relax. I assure you, I only wanted to speak with you, hence the rather rude and abrupt way I brought you here. Do accept my apologies.</span>”</p>
<p>“What? Oh, no, it wasn’t rude—”</p>
<p>Erin tried to wave one hand and hold the tea cup and saucer while Ressa put the chess board on the table between the two. Lady Magnolia smiled again.</p>
<p>“I’m told you play chess quite well, and I must confess, I had hoped you would indulge me in a game.”</p>
<p>“How did you know—?”</p>
<p>“Oh, a [Lady] has ways. Do pay it no mind. I would simply love to play a game with you while we chatted. I believe you’ve met a very striking Runner named Ryoka Griffin? <span style="color:#feedff;">I would so love for you to talk to me about her as we play.</span>”</p>
<p>And so they did. Erin blinked at first, but when Magnolia asked her whether she wanted to be white or black and they began playing the game, her chess instincts kicked in and she began to play, chatting as she did.</p>
<p>“So you knew Ryoka a long time before I did?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I had seen her delivering a number of curios to my house.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia replied casually as she moved her pieces out. She had learned to play somewhere, because her opening was a good match against Erin’s.</p>
<p>Ressa stood to one side of the table, silently listening to the conversation, hands folded in front of her. She was like a statue, and Erin thought it was sort of odd to have the head maid here on serving duty, but maybe that was just how it worked?</p>
<p>She was feeling a lot more relaxed than she had been, even more than when she had been with the other people from her world. Lady Magnolia’s open face and natural charm just…invited Erin to talk.</p>
<p>And so she did, about Ryoka, about her job as an innkeeper, and the people she had met and the monsters she’d had to kill. Lady Magnolia was an excellent audience, and they were halfway through the game when the conversation changed.</p>
<p>“The undead and Goblin tribes? My, you <em>are</em> adventurous. I had the impression you were quite self-sufficient, but I had no idea you were quite so extraordinary.”</p>
<p>Erin blushed at the compliment. Lady Magnolia smiled, and she picked up something on the table. A monocle, but a very strange one. This one had a rim made of black rock—obsidian? And it looked like tiny runes had been carved into the sides that made the glass move with odd colors.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia blinked at Erin through the monocle for a few seconds, and then put it down lightly with a shrug.</p>
<p>“A simple keepsake. It helps with bad eyesight. I confess, my vision is not what it used to be. Age, you know? <span style="color:#fddbff;">Pray, ignore it.</span>”</p>
<p>“Oh. Okay.”</p>
<p>The game continued. Erin frowned. Lady Magnolia was <em>quite</em> good. Erin had taken several of her pieces, but the other woman was doing just as well.</p>
<p>“You’re a great player. I’ve only met a few people as good as you.”</p>
<p>“You are too kind.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia beamed as she delicately moved a pawn to block one of Erin’s bishops. She looked at Ressa.</p>
<p>“Young Erin really does have a way with words, doesn’t she Ressa? I fear I am going to blush.”</p>
<p>Ressa bowed her head slightly. Magnolia turned back to Erin, smiling again.</p>
<p>“In truth, I fear I don’t play nearly as much as I should. But I did learn the game when I was sixteen, and I’ve played regularly with at least one good opponent since then. Still, I am glad that I can keep up with someone of your caliber.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded distractedly. Whatever Lady Magnolia said, she was some kind of expert. She was pressing Erin hard, and the game required her concentration, which made her happy.</p>
<p>But she did notice something happen. Perhaps it was because she’d gotten to know Ressa earlier, but when Lady Magnolia spoke about playing chess, the other woman had…shifted slightly. It was just a slight movement of her feet, and in anyone else Erin would have dismissed it as being tired or sore. But Ressa had been like a statue throughout the game and the conversation, and somehow it struck Erin as odd.</p>
<p>It was because she was playing chess that Erin noticed it. It was the odd sense she sometimes got, of being aware of the board and the room as a whole at the same time. In two seconds Erin had nearly forgotten what she’d noticed.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“Ah, but this is hardly the time to talk about my past, is it? I am glad you are here, Erin. I was afraid you might turn down my invitation if you were anything like Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she is like that, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled, and Lady Magnolia laughed again.</p>
<p>“Well, we were all like that, weren’t we?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I was.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but you are so open it’s quite refreshing. I trust the carriage ride was pleasant? I only ask because I was afraid you might have lacked for company. A single [Butler] for a driver is rather sparse company, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Erin blinked. She looked up from her game at Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>“The butler? You mean Reynold? No, he was great. I really liked him.”</p>
<p>And again, there it was. This time it wasn’t Ressa who shifted, but Lady Magnolia’s hand paused for just one fraction of a moment as she lifted the tea cup to her lips.</p>
<p>“Ah yes, Reynold. It is good that you know his name. You know, your friends never bothered to ask any of the names of the servants that attend them. Or is friends too strong a word?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia’s eyes flicked up to Erin’s face searchingly. Erin wasn’t sure how to respond. She wasn’t friends with Joseph and Rose—they weren’t people she disliked, but friends? No.</p>
<p>But what was the polite way to say that? Erin didn’t know, and fortunately Magnolia didn’t seem to require an answer. The woman laughed as she delicately advanced a pawn two spaces to threaten one of Erin’s knights.</p>
<p>“Do excuse me; I <em>am</em> rude today, aren’t I? Of course not everyone from one world would know each other, let alone be friends. On the other hand, I would be delighted to say that I am now your friend.”</p>
<p>Friend? That sounded right. Erin’s stomach stirred slightly, but not in hunger. She frowned. Something was nagging at her. Oh yeah. That was important.</p>
<p>“Um. Lady Magnolia—”</p>
<p>“Magnolia, please, Erin. <span style="color:#fddbff;">We’re all friends here, aren’t we?</span>”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, sorry—um, well, you know that I’m from another world, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I do indeed.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Lady Magnolia as her hand hovered over a chess piece. She felt that was far too calm a response. Lady Magnolia noticed Erin’s expression and waved a hand.</p>
<p>“Please. I know how extraordinary this is, but I have had quite a while to process this fact. And what kind of [Lady] would I be if I were not collected and calm at all times? I know you are from another world. I know the other charming young men and women downstairs are from another world. That is why I have gathered you all here.”</p>
<p>She moved a piece forwards and took one of Erin’s knights. Erin frowned. She’d played a great counter to Lady Magnolia’s move, but suddenly she’d just lost two pieces in a cunning fork that had completely blindsided her. That was normal—but Erin couldn’t believe Lady Magnolia had seen through her so quickly.</p>
<p>Amazing. She tried to focus on the conversation as she continued playing, focusing harder on her pieces.</p>
<p>“Uh—well—then why are we all here?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia studied Erin for a second, and then deftly moved a bishop out of harm’s way. Not immediate harm’s way, but out of a trap that would have come two moves later.</p>
<p>“Well, I hope you will stay here. Now that you have seen my small estate, I hoped I would be able to convince you and perhaps even Ryoka to accept my hospitality for as long as you stay in this world. <span style="color:#ffb8fd;">You will say yes, won’t you?</span>”</p>
<p>Something was seriously wrong. Not about the conversation, but on the chess board. Erin could sense it. Lady Magnolia was no great player. She was good, but nowhere near as good as someone who’d memorized opening and strategies like Erin. Her opening game had shown that, and even now she made small mistakes no seasoned player would make simply by virtue of experience.</p>
<p>And yet, she kept hitting Erin in exactly the worst places, or started pulling her pieces out of the way when Erin tried to attack or set traps. It was almost as if she could read Erin’s mind.</p>
<p>Maybe she could. Erin glanced up. Lady Magnolia was smiling at her.</p>
<p>“Um, sorry. What did you say?”</p>
<p>The other woman blinked. So did Ressa. Erin grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. It’s just that when I get into chess, I sort of—sorry!”</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all. Do excuse me. I should be focusing on the game as well.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia moved a piece forwards, blocking Erin’s advance that would have threatened her Rook. Erin frowned. Maybe—</p>
<p>She moved a pawn forwards. It was a ranging attempt, meant to pressure Magnolia’s pieces back so Erin could get a shot at her King.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia castled. Erin saw the move, and felt the pieces fall into place. She looked up, and saw Lady Magnolia’s smiling again. She had such a nice smile.</p>
<p>“I was just wondering if you would stay here. <span style="color:#ffb8fd;">If you would, I would greatly appreciate—</span>”</p>
<p>“—Excuse me. You’re reading my mind, aren’t you? I mean, you’re doing something to me, right?”</p>
<p>The room froze. Lady Magnolia paused, mouth open mid-word, and Erin felt Ressa’s eyes boring into her. But she stared at the [Lady] opposite her calmly.</p>
<p>Nobles and maids. Neither one had obvious expressions, but now Erin had learned what to look for. Magnolia’s eyes flickered to Erin’s face, and then she sighed.</p>
<p>“Am I really that transparent?”</p>
<p>She half-turned in her seat and frowned at her maid.</p>
<p>“Ressa, why didn’t you <em>tell</em> me I was being that obvious?”</p>
<p>“You appeared to be quite subtle, milady.”</p>
<p>“I thought so too. Ah, well.”</p>
<p>It was as if someone had flipped a switch. Lady Magnolia sighed and put down her tea cup. Erin blinked at her.</p>
<p>“And here I thought I would get away with everything quite easily. Oh well. I suppose you’ve found me out. What will you do now?”</p>
<p>She looked at Erin expectantly. Erin blinked at her, hesitated.</p>
<p>“Um. Uh. I guess I’ll ask you not to do it when we’re playing chess?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia paused as she stretched her hands out. She eyed Erin. Ressa was doing the same.</p>
<p>“When we’re playing chess?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Well actually, I don’t mind it so much, but it would have been good to know. I was actually just curious if you <em>were </em>doing it.”</p>
<p>Ressa and Magnolia exchanged a look. Lady Magnolia sat back in her couch.</p>
<p>“Ah. I see.”</p>
<p>She paused. Erin stared at her. The silence grew uncomfortable, and then Lady Magnolia smiled.</p>
<p>“I most sincerely apologize. I wished to see you playing your best, and so I broke the rules most shamefully. Allow me to concede and tender you my deepest regrets. If you wish, we could restart and play another game fairly…”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“No. Actually, I’d like to play another game just like we are right now.”</p>
<p>A second blink. This time Lady Magnolia’s eyes met Erin’s, and the girl felt a slight jolt.</p>
<p>“Intriguing. Why, pray?”</p>
<p>The young woman shrugged awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I think it would be sort of fun. But you <em>are</em> reading my mind?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. It’s nothing as advanced as knowing what you’re thinking; I possess a skill called [Sense Intention] and I am quite adept at using it. I can sense which pieces you are focusing on, which allowed me to play as well as I did.”</p>
<p>“Cool.”</p>
<p>“Cool?”</p>
<p>“That’s so <em>cool.</em>”</p>
<p>Erin grinned. She looked at the board and began moving pieces back to their starting positions.</p>
<p>“Can you do it again? While we’re playing, I mean. I want to see if I can beat someone who can tell what I’m trying to do.”</p>
<p>For two seconds, Lady Magnolia stared at Erin with genuine surprise written all over her face. And then she gave Erin a real smile. It made all of her other smiles seem fake and plastic by comparison, because it was truly, wonderfully filled with delight and mirth.</p>
<p>“I should be delighted. You are quite the unusual young lady, you know.”</p>
<p>“Really? I guess. Hmm. I guess I’ll start as white again.”</p>
<p>The game restarted. Erin put her pieces back in place, and wondered how to beat someone who could sense what she wanted to do. She noticed Ressa staring hard at her, and Lady Magnolia was looking at her completely differently now. With less confidence, and a lot more intently, as if she was trying to read Erin.</p>
<p>But Erin had learned to play chess with a poker face. She adopted her best one now, trying not to give away anything more than what Magnolia would sense. Erin began to play, in silence this time, and remembered the past.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, she’d loved chess. Then, later, she’d grown to hate it. She’d hated the memorization, the constant games, the agonizing over win/loss ratios, and the way chess had consumed her entire life, leaving time for little else.</p>
<p>She had grown distant from the game, and eventually stopped playing altogether, despite many people urging her not to waste her talents and quit. But Erin had grown sick of that small board, and she had been happier being normal.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet…Erin had passed through the years, and slowly she’d realized that chess had changed her. Even a casual game was different for her, because she was not an amateur, but she was still not a professional. No one in her school or even her district could challenge her, and yet the top of that strange world was still far away from her.</p>
<p>Too, Erin had slowly realized how much chess meant to her. Without it, she had nothing that set her apart from other people, and that was good and bad. She was tired of chess, yes, but she was meaningless without it.</p>
<p>And so, slowly, Erin had grown to love the game again. She’d played for fun, and then rediscovered the feeling she’d had when she first learned to play. She had begun to reenter the world of chess, and then she’d travelled into another world.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>If there was a god of Chess, or perhaps, a goddess, they were a cruel, calculating god that bestowed their gifts like curses upon the people who lived to play. If there was a god.</p>
<p>A metaphorical god, that was. Not the actual gods and goddesses that claimed the game, but the living spirit of chess itself. Erin thought of it in that way. The God of Chess was silent and often cruel, living through cold stone and static rules that broke people across the unchanging boards. But she had touched god in her games, and when she had come to this world, he, she, it—had blessed her.</p>
<p>Immortal games. Opponents to teach and learn from and who loved the game as much as she did. Erin was no longer the same player she was. She might be clumsy, and stupid, and whatever else, but there was one thing Erin was good at. One thing in which she stood at the very peak of in either world. And that was—</p>
<p>“Checkmate.”</p>
<p>Erin moved her knight forwards and completed the trap. Magnolia’s king stared up at her, forlornly cornered by several pieces just waiting for him to make a move so they could dash his brains out.</p>
<p>“Remarkable.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia breathed the words as she gently tipped her king over. She looked up at Erin, and her eyes were full of light.</p>
<p>“I have seldom lost a game of chess when using [Sense Intentions], Erin Solstice. And even without it, I consider myself an adept player. But Skills matter very little against someone of your level of skill, or so it would seem.”</p>
<p>“It was a good game.”</p>
<p>That was all Erin could really say. She smiled and cracked her fingers before she realized that would be rude and blushed. Lady Magnolia chuckled.</p>
<p>“It was. Surprising as well; I had no idea it would be that obvious that I was reading you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I just have a sense with these things, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. <span style="color:#fd78ff;">I wonder, can you sense anything else?</span>”</p>
<p>Anything else? After scratching her head a bit, Erin shook it.</p>
<p>“Not really. I’m really only good at chess because I play it so much.”</p>
<p>“That is readily apparent. Indeed…”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia tapped her lips with one fingernail and sighed.</p>
<p>“I have a friend who I would dearly love to introduce you to. I suspect you might triumph if the two of you were to play a game of chess, and I would love to see the expression on his face if you do. You are certainly one of the best players in this world, I can see that for myself.”</p>
<p>Again, Erin felt herself turn red. Best player? In the world? That would be a complete and horrible lie in her world, but here? She wasn’t sure if she should feel happy or sad that was the case.</p>
<p>“A child who grew up studying a game which is…new to this world. How intriguing. But I would imagine there are least…five people who would be able to best you. Don’t you think the number is five, Ressa?”</p>
<p>“I would not know, milady.”</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>Magnolia smiled fondly at her maid. Erin was happy to see that; it seemed like she was friends with her servants. But what she’d said caught Erin’s attention. The chess maniac in her raised its head.</p>
<p>“Really? You know other people who like chess? Can you tell me their names?”</p>
<p>Maybe one of them was the person who’d sent her the chess board. It could happen. Magnolia studied Erin, and then smiled again. She seemed to like the secretive smile.</p>
<p>“They aren’t necessarily chess players, but they have the ah, skills and temperaments to be the best in any such game. But as to their names—I would hate to ruin the surprise. Let us just say they include an old fool, the world’s smallest strategist, a reclusive mage, a miserable king and a dashing and quite charming lord. One genius on each continent—except for Chandrar, that is. I don’t imagine the young [Emperor] or the King of Destruction’s Left Hand would be quite good enough to defeat you.”</p>
<p>That made no sense to Erin, except the King of Destruction, and she had no idea who his left hand might be. Assuming it wasn’t literal and he had a giant left hand that played chess. She’d heard of crazier things.</p>
<p>“Well, I just like chess. It’s not a big deal, but I’d love to meet them.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. Anyone who can claim to be one of the greatest experts in any field is worthy of note and admiration.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia leaned forwards and refilled Erin’s tea cup herself, against Ressa’s mild protests.</p>
<p>“That is simply another reason why I must insist you stay at my home. I would be delighted if you would act as a chess teacher, or if you simply consented to play games against some of my guests.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> why I requested you visit me. Why else did you think you were here? For the pleasure of your company of course, but I believe it would only be right to offer you the same hospitality I have given to the others.”</p>
<p>Erin’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>“Really? <em>Here?</em>”</p>
<p>“Is it so surprising? I believe you would quite enjoy your stay. We could put you up in a guest room, perhaps, until more permanent accommodations could be found. What do you say? <span style="color:#fd78ff;">Won’t you accept?</span>”</p>
<p>For some reason, the offer sounded extremely generous to Erin. Of course it was, but she couldn’t take it, right?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because—</p>
<p>Erin shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>“No, but I—I have an inn.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia’s smile didn’t waver. She lifted the tea cup to her lips and drank a bit.</p>
<p>“Ah, but isn’t it terribly dangerous? Wouldn’t it be easier to relax in comfort rather than risk your life working such a difficult job?”</p>
<p>“I like it. I mean, it’s hard, yeah, but—”</p>
<p>Erin wanted to accept Magnolia’s generous offer. Part of her did. But another part was thinking of everyone she would have to leave behind. Ceria, Selys, Krshia who was in trouble, Toren, Pisces, Rags, even Lyonette. What would that girl do without her? And then there was Ryoka—</p>
<p>But Magnolia was speaking more quickly now, and Erin found herself hanging on every word.</p>
<p>“Far better if you stay here with the others. They will become excellent adventurers, and you will all be safe here. <span style="color:#fb00ff;">Don’t you agree?</span>”</p>
<p>Erin wavered. But only for a second. Why was she even arguing about this? Lady Magnolia had been so generous to her and everyone from her world. Why wouldn’t she accept? She would be comfortable here, happy—</p>
<p>But it would make her friends upset. Erin knew that, and it hurt, but her desire to say ‘yes’ was far, far stronger.</p>
<p>So she wavered. Only for a second. But that second was an eternity upon which Erin stood, gazing out at two forks in the road of her life. She held her own destiny in her hands, and weighed each choice, remembering the past.</p>
<p>A second became a moment. A moment became a day, then a year. The year became eternal. And in that immortal moment, Erin realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>She was not in control. Because as her mind weighed the choice, every part of her pointed towards her inn. Yet…<em>something</em> was telling her to say yes.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Erin felt it. It was a sense in the back of her head, the same thing she’d felt all throughout the conversation. Only, Erin hadn’t known it was even there, so insidious and quiet had it been. Yet now it was out in the open, exposed by her own Skill and relentless time.</p>
<p>One second passed. Lady Magnolia was staring at Erin intently, and so was Ressa.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>The air smelled of lavender. Erin shook. Her mouth opened to say yes. She bit her tongue.</p>
<p>“Mmngh!”</p>
<p>Blood filled Erin’s mouth, and pain shot through her mind, breaking her out of whatever was holding her. Lady Magnolia blinked, and Erin <em>kicked</em> the table over, sending both drinks and chess pieces flying.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia stared at the flying objects in shock. A tea pot full of hot liquid flew towards her head. She did not raise her arms to block or try to move out of the way. She simply stared at the flying pot with a look of mild surprise on her face.</p>
<p>A hand shot out and grabbed the pot. A body interposed itself, and the hot liquid splashed against her back. Ressa flung the pot away and reached for Erin. The girl saw the hand reaching for her throat, as quick as lightning—</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>Ressa stopped. She stepped back, and the chess board <em>cracked </em>against one wall, the delicate wood breaking with the force of the impact. Chess pieces rained across the carpet and Lady Magnolia sighed.</p>
<p>“Teriarch <em>did</em> say this would happen sooner or later. But did it have to happen when I put my favorite tea pot out?”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Ressa. Her [Dangersense] was clanging loudly in her head. The [Head Maid] was staring at Erin, but there was nothing maid-like about the look in her eyes. She looked like she was ready to kill.</p>
<p>“Ressa. Your lovely rear end is in my face. Move aside please, and have someone clean up this mess.”</p>
<p>Ressa paused. She turned and Lady Magnolia patted her.</p>
<p>“It’s quite alright. Erin isn’t going to try and kill me, or so I believe. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Um. Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Well then.”</p>
<p>Ressa hesitated, and then moved swiftly to one side. She withdrew a bell from her pocket and rang it. In four seconds, the door opened and maids rushed in. They stopped when they saw the mess, but Ressa began snapping orders and they sprang into action.</p>
<p>“Do follow me. I think we had better let them get to work, and I would hate to get in their way.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia nodded to the doors. Erin stood up and followed the older woman as Ressa stood uncomfortably close behind her.</p>
<p>“Ressa! Stop that!”</p>
<p>Two minutes later, they were in another sitting room, a larger one that lacked the intimacy—and the pink—of the first. Lady Magnolia sighed as she sat. She looked at Ressa.</p>
<p>“I hope you weren’t burned too badly by the tea.”</p>
<p>“It was lukewarm.”</p>
<p>“And your dress? Feel free to change it.”</p>
<p>Ressa glanced at Erin before replying.</p>
<p>“I am quite comfortable, milady.”</p>
<p>“Stubborn.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia sighed, but she turned to Erin. This time she did not smile, but just looked at Erin. Just looked.</p>
<p>And then everything came full circle. Because her gaze was like a spotlight, and it fixed Erin in place. It was the same look she’d given Erin when the girl had first come in; a searching stare that tried to strip everything that Erin was away and see her inner self.</p>
<p>Erin stared back. She wasn’t good at staring, but she’d gotten a lot better. And now that she knew what was happening, anger was fueling her stare just as much as anything else. Her stomach tried to roil, but even this was still better than the pure terror Skinner had brought.</p>
<p>It was like staring into a jet engine, or the sun. Erin felt like she was literally about to be blown away—her body was shaking just trying to keep still. But she kept staring.</p>
<p>And then it was over. Lady Magnolia blinked, and Erin could look away. She looked around and saw Ressa was standing far away from the two of them, looking at a wall. The maid looked back at the two of them, and Lady Magnolia sighed.</p>
<p>“I cannot underestimate anyone these days, it seems. First Ryoka, and now you. I thought she was rather unique, but perhaps it was she who was merely uncommon.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t understand that. She stared at Lady Magnolia and wondered what to say.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Uninspired.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia frowned at Erin.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Erin frowned back. Lady Magnolia shook her head.</p>
<p>“After all that insightfulness, force of will, and commendable chess playing ability, <em>that</em> is hardly a question worthy of you, Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>A small pit of anger had been bubbling in Erin’s stomach since she’d realized what had been happening to her. It grew a bit larger.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that I’m not smart enough to ask the right questions.”</p>
<p>“Oh <em>hush</em>.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia reached out and tapped Erin’s nose. The girl blinked in outrage and the woman continued.</p>
<p>“I am complimenting you, Miss Solstice. You have quite magnificently foiled two schemes of mine, which so rarely happens that I am in shock. And yet you appear quite naïve in other matters, which is why I will be extraordinarily blunt.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. What was all—?”</p>
<p>“I was attempting to persuade you to join the group of rather sorry individuals I have managed to save from being torn apart or beaten to death so that I might protect you. I confess I was also testing your ability in chess in the hopes you could be useful, but my main goal was to simply sequester you away from the world where you would no longer be able to cause any harm.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia delivered the statement in a brisk, matter-of-fact tone of voice that lacked any smiles or charm. She stared at Erin. Erin stared back.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I believed you were not like Ryoka Griffin. Now, I believe it might be Ryoka Griffin who I must measure against you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>
<p>“Good. I would hate for you to be as perspicacious in all things as you are at evading my Skills.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t know what perspicacious meant either, but she bit her tongue and listened. Lady Magnolia paused.</p>
<p>“Tea please, Ressa. Raspberry, I think. Cooled.”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded, and Lady Magnolia turned back to Erin.</p>
<p>“When I first met Ryoka Griffin, I believed one thing. I believed I had either met the most capable and amazing young woman I had ever encountered, or that I had met someone who possessed knowledge she could not possibly acquire in this world. Possibly both.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia flicked her fingers, and Erin saw she was holding the monocle again. She peered at Erin through it again, frowning as she continued.</p>
<p>“I believed she was unique, but I soon learned that she was not. I soon realized she was one of many, and that led me to find the others like her and question them.”</p>
<p>“With torture? Did you find the others so you could—”</p>
<p>“No, and no. I found them because they were in danger. Two groups were dead, slain by monsters before I was even aware of the need for action. I found poor Imani nearly too late, but we saved her at least. The others, including young Rose, were far easier to locate and retrieve. And I <em>asked</em> them about their world, using [Charm] to persuade them to reveal more than they otherwise would, yes, but it was hardly difficult. Drink and a lovely woman or lovely young man listening attentively does wonders.”</p>
<p>Erin could believe that. She was trying to follow what was happening, and that was hard because she was still reeling from what had happened.</p>
<p>First, Lady Magnolia was nice. Then it turned out she was using a Skill on Erin, hence the table flip. But she <em>didn’t</em> want Ressa to smash Erin’s brains out, which the [Head Maid] could possibly maybe do. So Erin was safe. For now. And now it turned out Lady Magnolia wanted to find everyone from Erin’s world because she’d met Ryoka. Because…?</p>
<p>“Why? Why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia rolled her eyes, but Erin cut her off.</p>
<p>“I’m just a girl. From another world, right, but why are you so interested in us? Is it because we know things you don’t?”</p>
<p>“You come from another world. Of course you know many things we do not. I wished to ascertain what exactly that was, and when I realized what a vast difference in technology we possess, I immediately decided that you, Ryoka, and anyone else from your world must not be allowed to talk freely.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I <em>wish</em> you would stop asking me that question. You are quite intelligent enough to know why.”</p>
<p>Erin thought.</p>
<p>“Guns?”</p>
<p>“Among other things, yes. But merely the existence of another world would drive many Kings and fools into a frenzy and might begin a war that I am sure, absolutely <em>sure</em> that my world would lose. The nations of your world possess weapons far too deadly for all but the greatest magics to overcome, and the cost regardless would be far too great.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia looked up as Ressa let a maid approach with a pot of tea. She accepted a cup and Erin refused hers.</p>
<p>“If I intended to poison or drug—well, perhaps raspberry is not for everyone. I delight in sweet things. I digress however; even putting aside the knowledge that your world exists, any one weapon from your world would be deadly if knowledge of how to make them spread. Fortunately, not one of the children I found knew the exact details of how to make these weapons, and so my beliefs changed again.”</p>
<p>A hand tightened on the stem of the teacup, and Erin realized Lady Magnolia’s voice was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>“The technologies they so thoughtlessly spoke of would bring this world to ruin, but fortunately none of them know how to make any of what they claim is possible.”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded at this, one of the few movements Erin had ever seen her make. Magnolia continued.</p>
<p>“The few experts I know of and one…worldly confidant of mine assure me that even if this knowledge has spread, which I am sure it has, it will take years and quite a lot of groundwork to reproduce on a larger scale. And I shall search this world for traces of such preparation and quash it wherever it may be found.”</p>
<p>That sounded good. And it was good, wasn’t it? Erin wasn’t sure what to think.</p>
<p>“And so, now I find myself back where I started. I believe Ryoka Griffin is an extraordinary young woman, if only because she knows when to keep her mouth <em>shut.</em>”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia stared at Erin as she sipped from her cup again. Erin folded her arms.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“Throw this tea cup at you if you continue asking such questions.”</p>
<p>“Fine. What are you going to do about Joseph and Rose and Imani and the others?”</p>
<p>“I intend to indulge their requests.  You know they have petitioned me—repeatedly—about becoming adventurers? All of the young men seem quite excited by the prospect, as young men often are. The young ladies would like to travel into the cities with pockets full of gold and shop, or so I gather.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned.</p>
<p>“They did tell me that. Joseph says you were going to help them. Give them magical weapons and armor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and they are quite excited about the prospect. I have a mind to send them out with a few guides and let them enlist as Bronze-rank adventurers, with perhaps a gift of coins and a few choice items. What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>She didn’t even have to think. Erin replied instantly.</p>
<p>“They’d all die in a heartbeat.”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded. Magnolia smiled briefly.</p>
<p>“It would be amusing, or perhaps, sad, to see. I don’t believe any of them have actually killed anything in their life, or even helped butcher an animal. That might have informed their opinions. Only young Imani seems sensible and she is distraught with grief.”</p>
<p>Erin glared at Lady Magnolia. So. That was the plan.</p>
<p>“Are you going to kill me too?”</p>
<p>“Kill you? Haven’t you been listening to what I have been saying?”</p>
<p>“But you <em>said—</em>”</p>
<p>“I <em>said</em> I would send them out to become adventurers. But I will not let them die. I believe a few non-life-threatening injuries and a healthy dose of terror would be good for them.”</p>
<p>“That’s mean.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, it’s quite generous considering that I do not owe them anything and I will be saving their lives in the long run.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned.</p>
<p>“You’re treating them like pawns or—or people to be manipulated. That’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia sighed in irritation.</p>
<p>“I will stop treating them as pawns when they stop treating my world as a game to be enjoyed. As it is, that drunk group of young travelers below us are thoughtless, careless individuals who insult my servants, cause messes, throw up in the upholstery, and <em>do not realize</em> the gravity of the situation. I believe half of them are convinced this is a fictional reality, a dream perhaps, or some kind of living game.”</p>
<p>Erin bit her lip. She couldn’t deny that. Lady Magnolia paused, and went on.</p>
<p>“Not all are so foolish. Rose for example seems to understand the need to meet with others from your world, which is why I watch her in case she is called again on that…phone. And Imani is quite sensibly afraid of going out; I believe I will give her a bedroom away from the others now that you have opened her up.”</p>
<p>All of that still sounded suspicious to Erin. She stared at Lady Magnolia and raised a hand as if she were in school. Magnolia eyed it.</p>
<p>“Can I ask a question? Why I am I here?”</p>
<p>“You are here because I assumed you were like the others. I intended to confine you, perhaps after teaching you a few lessons about this world and the dangers therein.”</p>
<p>“And now?”</p>
<p>“I suppose you will have to go back to your inn. That is, unless you wish to accept my offer of hospitality. It still stands, and I would allow you to travel if you so wished.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia paused. She looked behind Erin.</p>
<p>“Ressa.”</p>
<p>A hand <em>smacked</em> Erin lightly on the back of the head. Erin yelped and turned, but Ressa stared blankly ahead, face expressionless. Lady Magnolia tapped her tea cup with one nail to get Erin’s attention.</p>
<p>“Consider my position, Erin Solstice. I have found visitors, or perhaps, refugees from another world. They know of terrible weapons, but have not the knowledge to create them. And yet, even the knowledge that such things can be created is enough to cause destruction in the long run. And these children—yes, children—are by and large helpless. They are walking magnets for chaos, and I dislike chaos.”</p>
<p>Erin sat in her seat and thought about that.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Guns would be bad.”</p>
<p>A hand smacked her on the back of the head again. Erin turned around, and Lady Magnolia smiled.</p>
<p>“I believe the young woman will hit you if you do that again, Ressa. And she has both [Bar Fighting] and [Minotaur Punch] as skills. I would be careful.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia lifted the monocle in her lap.</p>
<p>“A little device made for me by a friend. It allows me to read [Skills] and [Levels] unless they are concealed. I would love to know what [Immortal Moment] and [Wondrous Fare] do, by the way. But to your point—yes, many of the technologies the others have described sound incredibly dangerous. I do not wish for any of them to become public knowledge.”</p>
<p>Erin rubbed her head as she nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s what Ryoka’s afraid of. She doesn’t want anyone to find out what we know.”</p>
<p>“And that is why I wish to speak with her. But, quite ironically, she is the one person who rightfully distrusts anyone like me.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that smart?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia waved a hand. She drained her cup and placed it on a table.</p>
<p>“It is an excellent assumption to make. But in this case, I believe Miss Ryoka and I—and even you, Erin—are all on the same side.”</p>
<p>“And what side is—”</p>
<p>Erin looked at Ressa. The other woman’s hands hadn’t moved, but her lips twitched. Erin scowled.</p>
<p>“What side is that? It’s a smart question!”</p>
<p>Ressa shrugged impassively. Lady Magnolia rubbed at her eyes.</p>
<p>“I suppose it is? Erin, we are all on the side that wishes for peace, prosperity, and a lack of monsters or wars. I think that is a fair statement for me to make.”</p>
<p>“Right. I’m on that side.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded reluctantly. Lady Magnolia nodded as well.</p>
<p>“Most people are, but the problems emerge when selfish individuals place their own desires above that cause. Hence the infighting and petty bickering which grips both Drakes and Humans on this continent, and to a lesser extent, the Gnolls.”</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>“We waste time and resources killing each other while the true enemy grows stronger. Ah, if only the [Lords] and [Ladies] of this continent could see what I see. But of course, some do and others only pretend to. Vision is not hereditary, I’m afraid. And it is opinion which matters more.”</p>
<p>“So you’re afraid these nobles will cause trouble if they know what we—I—people from my world know?”</p>
<p>“<em>Anyone</em> would cause trouble with such knowledge, Erin. Anyone. But some would be more dangerous than others, I admit.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned. She needed a notepad, or something to write on to figure everything out. But she did her best.</p>
<p>“Let me get this straight. You found Ryoka, and realized she was from another world.”</p>
<p>“<em>Possibly</em> from another world. I had other suspicions at first.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but you found her and found other people. And when  you realized that we all know bad things—”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia winced at Erin’s choice of words. Erin glared.</p>
<p>“—You decided to keep us all here so we don’t cause any trouble. But you’re letting me go?”</p>
<p>“Because you are not as thoughtless as the others, and moreover, because I believe you will do more good where you are than under lock and key.”</p>
<p>“And Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“The same, although if she would consent to helping me, it would make my life so much easier.”</p>
<p>“So you can make guns?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia said that flatly. She stared Erin straight in the eye.</p>
<p>“I will never create these weapons. Not unless someone else has already spread them to the point where they have become commonplace.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“A thousand reasons, not least of which is that it would destroy this world. Ryoka knows this, which is why she has sensibly avoided me for fear I would use such weapons.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded. That was what Ryoka had said, more or less, so she supposed she could believe Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>“And where is Ryoka?”</p>
<p>The other woman paused. She looked at Erin, and then shook her head.</p>
<p>“If she has not told you, I will honor her discretion as a Runner. I do worry that she is well of course; but we must make gambles, and I rather like the idea of rolling the dice, especially if my die is Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>“You’re gambling with her life?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia looked insulted that Erin looked upset.</p>
<p>“Of course. Every person of note and power on the continent is a gambler who plays for the highest of stakes, Erin Solstice. Except for the Antinium Grand Queen. I’m afraid she only takes safe bets with acceptable risks. But until I am sure I play against her and her alone, I must resign myself to uncertainty. And to minimize that risk, I find it is important to get to know people.”</p>
<p>“Like me.”</p>
<p>“If you like. Now, let me offer you a few reassurances. I will not harm the others from your world…unduly. Nor will I share their dangerous secrets, unless of course there is something actually valuable from your world that might be used in this one. I would quite like to taste a pizza and hamburger, you know. Perhaps you could leave the recipe with my [Chef] before you go?”</p>
<p>“Um—”</p>
<p>“Also, I am not interested in harming or impeding you or Ryoka in any way. I simply desire your cooperation and perhaps your help. Actually, I desire Ryoka for all these things, but I shall include you as well.”</p>
<p>“To do what exactly? Making the world a better place?”</p>
<p>“If you could do that, I would be most grateful. No—in helping to defeat the one enemy that truly threatens this continent. The Antinium.”</p>
<p>Erin’s brain halted when she heard that. She cleared her throat, wishing she’d taken another cup of tea, and then spoke.</p>
<p>“The Antinium…aren’t your enemies.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia raised a finger.</p>
<p>“A few Antinium you are acquainted with may not be my enemy. But the rest are. Indeed, if their Queen ordered it, I would not place high odds that they would not cut you apart.”</p>
<p>Erin swallowed.</p>
<p>“Pawn and Klbkch wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia raised an incredulous eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t they? How much do you know of the Antinium? How much do you know of Klbkch the Slayer’s past?”</p>
<p>Klbkch the Slayer? Erin had never heard of that title. She opened her mouth, but the other woman waved her to silence.</p>
<p>“I am Lady Magnolia Reinhart. I have no enemies upon this continent, or so it is said. And yet I consider the Antinium Queens my greatest nemeses. Consider that for one moment, and please, <em>think</em> before you reply.”</p>
<p>Erin opened her mouth, hesitated, glared at Ressa, and then thought. Magnolia watched her, not without a bit of sympathy.</p>
<p>“The Antinium do battle much in the way your world fights, or so I gather.”</p>
<p>Erin blinked. Lady Magnolia smiled and clarified her statement.</p>
<p>“What I mean is, they fight under the assumption all soldiers are equal. They raise their warriors to be excellent, but no individual is better than another in their doctrine. That is because the Antinium do not level. But other armies fight differently.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia lifted her cup, accepted a refill from Ressa and drank a bit before continuing. Erin saw Ressa glance at her mistress, and something flickered across the maid’s face. It almost looked like…worry?</p>
<p>“In this world, an individual can change the course of a battle. A single hero can win a war. And that is because we level. Armies protect their highest-level warriors, or risk them in order to deal damage to opposing forces. But a hundred Level 15 [Soldiers] would not be worth the life of a single Level 30 [Vanguard]. So we sacrifice the many for the good of the few, that they might grow stronger. <em>That</em> is the difference between our worlds.”</p>
<p>Erin tried to imagine it. It wasn’t actually that hard. It was like…superheroes. They could fight entire armies by themselves, and that was sort of like a high-level warrior, right? Lady Magnolia nodded.</p>
<p>“Now consider this. What would happen if your world’s technology fell into Antinium hands? Or rather, feelers?”</p>
<p>Erin tried to imagine that. Her heart sank.</p>
<p>“Weapons of war. Tanks, these flying planes of yours, and of course, ‘bombs’. Terrible weapons that require no levels to use. And worse still, a gun. A weapon with exceptional range that can fire faster than a repeating crossbow if made correctly. Such weapons would allow even children to kill the greatest of warriors. All races would take that technology and kill with it, but the Antinium would benefit most greatly. <em>That </em>is why this technology must not be realized in this world.”</p>
<p>Again, Erin raised her hand. She lowered it when she saw Magnolia staring at it.</p>
<p>“Um, but why wouldn’t you just use a gun or something and not share the way the weapons are made?”</p>
<p>“Aside from the obvious point that any weapon can be used against its owner, I have found that nothing stays secret for long. The instant a weapon is used, it is copied a thousand times over. Have you not witnessed this yourself?”</p>
<p>Erin thought of her hamburgers and had nothing to say. Lady Magnolia sighed again.</p>
<p>“If these ‘guns’ were to become widespread, two groups would benefit most from their usage. In less than a decade, the House of Minos would fall to its ancient enemy and the Antinium would sweep across the continent.”</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“Were things otherwise, and were I more foolish, I might even consider manufacturing these devices myself, regardless of the risk, to deal with the Antinium. With them, I could create an army capable of killing Dragons; a force that would humble even Flos on the field of battle. But I am a bit wiser than that. By the time I defeated the Antinium—and that is still not wholly predictable—the entire world would be armed thusly, and we would burn nations to the ground and slaughter entire species before the bloodletting was done. No.”</p>
<p>Erin was quiet for a while after that. She didn’t know <em>what </em>to think of Lady Magnolia. The woman herself sipped her tea quietly as she watched Erin. At last, Erin looked up.</p>
<p>“I still don’t think they’re your enemies. The Antinium, I mean.”</p>
<p>“You do not know their history. You have not seen what they do.”</p>
<p>“Kill people? But Humans do that.”</p>
<p>“And we are a wretched species. But the Antinium are sadly better at killing than we are, and their Queens attempted to wipe this continent free of every living species once before. Consider this, Erin. Even in war, [Lords] and [Generals] often spare civilians. It is a point of honor, and practicality. Not even [Soldiers] relish that level of violence, and so the few who slaughter are condemned by every nation.”</p>
<p>She raised a finger.</p>
<p>“But the Antinium have fought thusly from the beginning. They leave no survivors. And what is worse, they make no permanent peace. I believe they have simply been waiting since the last Antinium War, building their strength for the final war in which they will win and slaughter us all.”</p>
<p>Erin couldn’t believe it. Klbkch, do that? But—she’d seen him killing Goblins that one time. And yet Pawn—</p>
<p>“It is not the individuals I speak of, but their Queens. They are heartless and care nothing for other species. If you will not believe it of the Antinium you know, believe that.”</p>
<p>Erin could. She remembered the Queen, and the cold way she had spoken about Klbkch, her subject.</p>
<p>“So that’s it? You’re fighting a war and you want help from us?”</p>
<p>“…If you want to put it that way, yes. Rather, I simply hope you will not make things worse. I don’t expect much help from you.”</p>
<p>“Hey, that’s—!”</p>
<p>“Accurate.”</p>
<p>Erin opened her mouth. Lady Magnolia stared at her. Erin closed her mouth.</p>
<p>“Erin Solstice. A young woman who treats Goblins like people and teaches the Antinium how to become individuals. That alone makes you extraordinary, but it will not win a war.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia drummed her fingers on her leg.</p>
<p>“I should like nothing more than for the Antinium to <em>all</em> become individual. That would mean they are people, and people can be manipulated, flattered, bribed, intimidated, or threatened. A swarm simply devours everything in its way. But it will not happen, because while the Queen in Liscor is a visionary, the other Queens and the Grand Queen lacks her ideals. No, it will not change what is to come.”</p>
<p>“And that is?”</p>
<p>“War. And not just any war. A world war, as your people have spoken of.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia said it calmly. She looked out one of the windows, at the setting sun.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it will not begin on this continent, but it will come soon. Already the idea of it hangs in the air, whispering in every ear.”</p>
<p>Erin felt a chill.</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“From whispers. It is hard to know everything, everywhere. The Isles of Minos, for instance, suffer few spies. Even so. A Goblin Lord has emerged in the south, and if a King should rampage again, we may all fall to the youngest species before the Antinium.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia started ticking off points on her fingers.</p>
<p>“Az’Kerash builds an army of the dead, and I only pray we may stop him. I would send heroes to slay him before he unleashes his madness, but they are in short supply. Between him and the Antinium, we face two major enemies, although one is far more dangerous than the other. An individual versus a swarm, you see? And then there are simply dangerous fools among the Drakes and Humans who would start bonfires over matchsticks anyways. Flos goes to conquer, and perhaps he is the least dangerous of all. He at least desires to create a kingdom rather than break everything apart. And all of this happens because of your people, Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>The room felt darker, and not just because the sun was setting. Erin tried to swallow around a dry mouth.</p>
<p>“My people?”</p>
<p>“We were at peace before you arrived, Erin Solstice. A factitious, torn peace full of petty battles and squabbles, yes, but peace nevertheless. The world was slowly healing, but all too soon the truce forged of paper will burst open like scabs and war will once more ravage the people and land.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia paused. The shroud around her lifted, and she looked over.</p>
<p>“Mm. That was quite good, wasn’t it, Ressa? I shall have to remember that to Teriarch next time we speak. Write that down, would you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, milady.”</p>
<p>Magnolia turned back to Erin.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to sound completely hopeless. There are threats, true, but I hope that my preparations will guard against some of them. This continent is strong, and I have done my best to ensure the north is stronger than it was. But that is the truth of it. War is coming. And you few travelers are caught in it.”</p>
<p>Erin tried to breathe and had trouble doing so. It seemed so huge when Magnolia said it like that.</p>
<p>“What should we do, then? I mean, is there anything—?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. You can help those you meet in your inn, and perhaps that will change things. But unless you know of a technology that saves lives…? There are a number of curious things the other young men and women talk about, but they are frustratingly vague on details. I will pursue that line of questioning, however.”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“I still don’t think it’s right, keeping them here.”</p>
<p>“And what would you do? Let them loose?”</p>
<p>Magnolia frowned at Erin. Erin shrugged.</p>
<p>“Maybe not, but they’re not as stupid as you’re treating them.”</p>
<p>“Fools seldom are. But they are thoughtless, which is worse. What could they do that would not cause more harm?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But give them a chance.”</p>
<p>Magnolia paused as she sipped at her cup.</p>
<p>“A chance? As what, adventurers?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But just give them a chance to do <em>something </em>rather than lock them up and let them be useless.”</p>
<p>Erin tried to explain.</p>
<p>“I have this annoying—this girl in my inn. She’s really, really troublesome, but if I left her alone she would die.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Lyonette de Marquin. Dreadful girl. I’m not sure she is the example you should use.”</p>
<p>“You know who she is? I mean, she said she knows you—”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she does.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia made a face as if the tea had suddenly gone bad. Erin looked around and saw Ressa making a similar look of disgust, which disappeared as soon as she noticed Erin looking.</p>
<p>“She says she’s really important and that you’d take her in. But the [Butler]—sorry, Reynold—wouldn’t let her come with me.”</p>
<p>Magnolia sighed as she swirled her tea around with a silver spoon.</p>
<p>“She certainly is…important, but I fear she overstates her value. She wrote me several strident letters demanding that I offer her the hospitality of my house. I do not wish to do so.”</p>
<p>“But she nearly died by herself! She was getting exiled and she would have frozen to death if I hadn’t found her!”</p>
<p>“A pity.”</p>
<p>Erin’s heart grew silent in her chest for a moment. She looked at Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>“Just because someone is really…<em>really</em> annoying or useless doesn’t mean they deserve to die.”</p>
<p>“Neither does it mean that I should waste time and resources saving them.”</p>
<p>“But that means you’re killing them if you don’t help. That’s <em>wrong.</em>”</p>
<p>A sigh. Erin gritted her teeth as Magnolia looked at her.</p>
<p>“What if they are a danger? What if killing them would save thousands of lives? Would that not be the most morally correct choice?”</p>
<p>Now Erin was getting angrier. Magnolia was—well, she wasn’t a bad person. Maybe. But she was getting on Erin’s nerves.</p>
<p>“You don’t get to decide that. God—gods know everything, so I guess if they existed, they’d be able to say if that was right or wrong. But the gods are dead. Everyone tells me that. So no one gets to decide if things are moral. You can kill however many people you want, but you can’t say it was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>“Fine then. I chose to let Lyonette die. I do not regret it, any more than I regret confining the others from your world. I cannot release them into the wild because they would die, and neither will I risk them spreading dangerous information as they so casually do. But they are quite a drain on resources.”</p>
<p>“So? You offered to take them in.”</p>
<p>“To save their lives. But I may soon lock them in a house and toss bags of grain inside rather than keep them here. They are not worthy of this house, or the people who must put up with them. They eat, argue, talk about games and laugh at monsters as if they were harmless, and talk to my servants about freedom as if they were <em>slaves.</em>”</p>
<p>“They do? I mean, really?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia scowled.</p>
<p>“One of them does, at any rate. She doesn’t seem to understand the difference between employing a family of their free will and forcing them to work.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if they’ve offended you. But—”</p>
<p>“I will give them a chance, which may be more than they deserve. Enough. It is growing late, and I wish to impress one thing upon you, Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Numbers. Or perhaps—worth.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia put down her cup and looked at Erin directly.</p>
<p>“The smallest of the Antinium Hives – the one based in Liscor – holds at least three thousand Antinium at any given time. More, as of late. At least two thousand Workers and a thousand Soldiers are ready to go to war at any moment; my estimate puts their numbers at a thousand more in their Hive. And that is the least of the six Hives, if there are only six. The others are larger by an immeasurable factor.”</p>
<p>The numbers staggered Erin. Three—no, <em>four thousand </em>Antinium? Why didn’t they help when Skinner attacked? But Lady Magnolia wasn’t done. She pointed at Erin.</p>
<p>“You are worth two Antinium Soldiers in a battle. Ryoka—with items, perhaps she could defeat a dozen. Two dozen. But I very much doubt it.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“As dangerous as you are, as unique as you are, you are only one Human. But I require an army. I seek heroes. I have children, bright and full of weapons that would shake the earth—none of which I can use now or without having them used against me in time. You and Ryoka Griffin are extraordinary in your own ways, but you are still young. And small.”</p>
<p>Magnolia looked towards the window.</p>
<p>“I will hope that you rise to the challenges you will face. If there is a way I may aid you that will encourage growth or help myself, I will do so. But I am playing a game against titans, and I am only a small Human.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t know what to say to that. Magnolia looked large and small at the same time—a giant in her own right, full of more force than anyone else Erin had met—but still so small compared to the things she talked about.</p>
<p>“If you are able to, I hope you will persuade Miss Ryoka to visit me. I am in need of whatever aid she can give; whatever she can remember. These new defensive potions and alchemist creations she has made cheaper will save countless lives in the long run. But convincing enough farmers to grow spicy peppers will be difficult. Bottles are equally expensive, but if it <em>can</em> be manufactured into a spray as young Rose claims…”</p>
<p>Magnolia sighed, and looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“Which brings me to you. You, Erin Solstice, the girl of many odd talents. You have skills, and a brain hidden behind all that fluff, but you maintain a small inn and do little with what you have. Is that all you will ever do? What is it you wish to do in this world, Miss Erin Solstice? Do you want to go home to your world? Or perhaps, do you want to stay here? This world is full of wonders, but I am sure yours is filled with just as many.”</p>
<p>Her eyes bored into Erin’s, unblinking, and Lady Magnolia’s voice seemed like the only thing in the world. Erin couldn’t look away as the questions hit her again and again.</p>
<p>“Will you protect this world? Save it? Do you simply want to live in peace? Or perhaps you would like to destroy it? Do you even care?”</p>
<p>Erin opened her mouth, but Lady Magnolia silenced her.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you have an answer that would not prompt me to throw something at you.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Really? This tea pot is quite heavy and quite expensive. I would hate to waste it.”</p>
<p>“I want to protect the people around me. That’s all. I have friends. I don’t want them to die. I want to help them, and some day find a way home. And live in peace. That’s all.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia stared at Erin for a while.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Well, at least you don’t have small dreams. Well then, Erin Solstice, delightful and infuriating as this conversation has been, I believe only one thing remains for me to do with you.”</p>
<p>Erin tensed. Ressa had moved behind Magnolia, but she was fast.</p>
<p>“And what’s that?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia smiled.</p>
<p>“Send you home.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a small group that gathered outside the coach. Reynold held the door open as Erin climbed in, and the girl realized that Joseph and Rose and the others were watching her from a window. And trying to shout to her, by the looks of it.</p>
<p>She’d wanted to say something to them, but Lady Magnolia had vetoed that suggestion. She claimed she had no desire to listen to another hundred complaints and besides, Erin had nothing to say to the others that they would not learn soon enough.</p>
<p>Erin had silently agreed with that, but she still glared at Lady Magnolia as she got into the carriage. She was fairly sure she didn’t like the [Lady], but at least in public Lady Magnolia was all smiles and rainbows.</p>
<p>“I trust Reynold will see you safely to your inn. I also took the liberty of sending a meal with you, as I shamefully neglected to play the good host. Do take care.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>
<p>The door began to close, but a slim hand interposed itself before it could shut. Erin wondered what would happen if she slammed the door, but then Magnolia opened it. She lowered her voice so that only Erin could hear.</p>
<p>“Oh, and by the way, Erin. Though I laud your desire to protect those around you, I believe you will soon find that answer means changing the entire world. So the question remains: what will you do? Will you try to save this world we live in, or wait for others to do it for you?”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Magnolia. The other woman was smiling.</p>
<p>“If I punch you, would Ressa kill me?”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s smile widened.</p>
<p>“Quite likely. Do agonize about your future on the ride home. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>The door closed. Reynold waited until Magnolia was clear, and then snapped the reins. The carriage began to move swiftly away, and Erin sat back in her seat.</p>
<p>“I think I really hate her.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia. She was like a hurricane trapped inside of a bottle inside of a tornado inside of a washing machine. She was all go, and even thinking about what she’d just learned made Erin want to vomit up thoughts.</p>
<p>And she was so <em>confident</em> she was right. She’d seen right through Erin. Or maybe—</p>
<p>Erin turned and glared out the window as Lady Magnolia’s mansion disappeared in the distance. She had a small thought in her head.</p>
<p>Maybe…she was actually a good person. A rich [Lady] trying to save the world by herself.</p>
<p>Probably not. She was still a jerk. But the things she’d said—</p>
<p>Outside, the world began to blur as Erin sped away from Lady Magnolia’s house, and back home. Thoughts whirled around in Erin’s head, not least of which was that Magnolia had put enough food in the carriage to feed both her and Reynold for a <em>week</em>. But that wasn’t as important as what she’d learned.</p>
<p>So many things. War? The Antinium? Were they really the biggest threat? Could Magnolia be trusted?</p>
<p>Erin wanted so desperately to talk to Ryoka about it all. But without anyone to talk to—besides Reynold, and he really couldn’t help with this—Erin found herself drifting off. Her mind began looping, and only a few thoughts repeated themselves.</p>
<p>What had Magnolia said? Choose. Erin thought she had an answer, but war? She couldn’t even imagine—</p>
<p>What should she do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Live alone.</p>
<p>Save the world.</p>
<p>Run away.</p>
<p>Ask for help.</p>
<p>Live in peace.</p>
<p>Fight for freedom.</p>
<p>Bring democracy.</p>
<p>Protect secrets.</p>
<p>Go back home.</p>
<p>Save the world.</p>
<p>Protect her friends.</p>
<p>Save the world.</p>
<p>Give up.</p>
<p>Save the world.</p>
<p>Save the world.</p>
<p>Save.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>World.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>GAHSDHGA. That&#8217;s my general state of mind. If writing Game of Thrones is this complex, no wonder Martin hasn&#8217;t come out with another book yet.</p>
<p>Yeah. I might actually have to rewrite significant parts of this. I actually had 2-3 pages of notes trying to figure out what I should reveal and what I need to hint at and&#8211;I left a lot out. But I got the most PLOT SIGNIFICANT CHAPTER (maybe) OUT AND IT IS DONE!</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. I&#8217;m going to go boil my head or do something relaxing. Whew. Magnolia is a hard character to write. Thanks for reading!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I love the depth of lady magnolia in this chapter. I think you really fleshed out her character well. You really made her more human*. Her and Ressa the danger maid make a cute couple.</p>
<p>*I have always got the impression that lady mags is a hard core, old school, fae. Like straight up hide your babies, don&#8217;t say thanks, titania of the summer court fae. It would make sense given her peers include a Dragon and a god like necromancer(or a necromancer trying to emulate one).</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Oh my god, that was a really awesome chapter :D<br />
&#8220;I left a lot out&#8221;<br />
If you plan to rewrite that chapter because you didn&#8217;t hint at enough things as you said you did, you might need to split it up into two chapters&#8230;.<br />
Also, I feel amazed at Magnolia, simply because she managed to explain to Erin the threat the otherworlders pose, something that Ryoka tried and spectacularly failed at :D</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>As complex as your story is, Game of Thrones is way more complex. However, I don&#8217;t like the GoT books (good TV show though), since I believe them to be NEEDLESSLY complex. Makes it hard to tell a story when you have to tell it from too many points of view. You&#8217;d end up writing 10 chapters and barely moving time forward a couple of days, or forcing readers to read about characters they dislike.</p>
<p>Thanks for the chapter and nice job on Magnolia, manipulative but helpful&#8230; I like it. Your doing awesome, I&#8217;ll take a nap for you and try to will it to you :D</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I found the concept of Erin wanting democracy to be&#8230; out of sorts. First off, she lives in something very much like a classic Grecian democracy. Those who stand out rise up, and are generally given place by society around them with individual voice. What it appears Erin is after is actually something she&#8217;s more familiar with. </p>
<p>Plus Erin is entirely anti-democratic. Seriously. I get what I want above the voice of society. She frankly does everything against the voice of others &#8211; often those who are placed through reasonable means, like the watch captain. The drake leveled, strove, and toiled within the bounds of society to produce a result that was both viable and measurable. Little miss thing then overrules it all for her voice of some personally specific judicial view of a fair state. Those really aren&#8217;t on the same page as concepts. And it hurts me a little to see it. Honestly, without some real and decent cause, Erin would be a criminal.  She would be at the very least a wild child nuisance in our world under similar circumstance. Erin is extremely intolerant of others, like our highly villainized Catholic missionaries of the fifteenth through eighteenth centuries. &#8220;Order through compliance and conversion to my way, and your world and soul shall be saved.&#8221; If she starts a tax, she&#8217;s the Holy Roman Catholic Church in it&#8217;s darker hours.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Most people, when they say meritocracy today, don&#8217;t mean it as a system of government, but of societal organization. Meritocracy is how we distribute jobs, opportunities&#8230; It&#8217;s how we justify our massive economic inequality. The idea that people who work hard, or are highly capable (according to some measure of those things) should be respected and rewarded, like the Guard Captain, is a meritocratic one, not one of democracy.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Apologies for the delay, as I was tucked away from general society for various reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;-ocracy&#8221; is a form of government or authority as an organization. It&#8217;s what the suffix means. Selecting the best candidate from an applicant pool while having multiple entry points does not make an organization meritocratic (it is in fact quite the opposite, defining observed meritorious behavior as non-consequential and limiting future growth.) Starting every entering person from the lowest common denominator and then allowing that person to reach specific roles based entirely upon their performance does. Merit-based decisions and meritocracies are substantially different things.</p>
<p>The council is not a meritocracy. It&#8217;s not terribly clearly defined, but at the very least roles are assigned by more than raw ability. Relc is repeatedly described as being the most able warrior in the city by class levels of one sort or another. Yet he was not the guard captain. Merit obviously did not post him above his peers, although it would have in an actual meritocracy (which does not consider things like desire to be paramount.) Moreover Olesm would have been a better candidate if it were based on tactical leadership. So it was not merely a merit driven decision.</p>
<p>Pertinently, military organizations frequently are run with meritocratic intent. The individual that can get the job done best is the one sent or assigned to do it. In the fight with Skinner, Realc was clearly ordered to perform in a certain way under just that kind of authority.</p>
<p>The surrounding society is also not significantly organized as a meritocracy, which would almost certainly appear as a caste system. Work can be found and levels can be gained based upon what an individual seeks to do rather than what they are told to do or learn first. Such a difference makes appointments more individualistic and not meritocratic.</p>
<p>The notable difference could be the Antinium, which are possibly meritocratic.</p>
<p>So once again: not really, no.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Deciding who gets a position based on their ability is very much meritocratic. It fits what you said!<br />
In any case, the position of guard captain is not just that of a fighter, or a strategist. It is one of command and law enforcement. Olesm, while the best strategist in the town, lacks experience as a law enforcement agent, and also as a combatant.<br />
In any case, debating the mere definition of meritocracy is irrelevant. The basic idea is that the decisions of who gets a position are not done in a democratic way, since no votes are held. Introducing that would be silly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit bummed Erin didn&#8217;t ask who brought then here. Lady Magnolia might not have said anything, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s researched how it could have happened, and the details of what did happen.</p>
<p>I mean we still don&#8217;t even know solid dates of when people transfer over. Is there a pattern for when they disappear from one world and when they appear in the other?</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you for all your effort. It&#8217;s always a delightful read.<br />
Lady Magnolia is just such a complicated character. I guess she&#8217;s your Littlefinger.<br />
I&#8217;ve been thinking about what the fairies called the skill system (a &#8220;thing of dead gods&#8221;, if I recall correctly) and I need to ask&#8230; Are you familiar with the plot of &#8220;Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s a Japanese Light Novel, of a complexity level lesser than Wandering Inn&#8217;s (at least in my opinion), but it that one moment reminded me of that too much not to ask.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I have read the manga and several hundred chapters of the translated story. I&#8230;didn&#8217;t like it that much, to be honest. The first part was amazing, but as soon as the power-leveling turned the main character into an undefeatable monster I stopped enjoying it.</p>
<p>Hm. There are some similarities in the stories, but I don&#8217;t recall the dead gods thing. I do remember reading it as I was writing The Wandering Inn and thinking at first that it was way more original than mine, though&#8230;</p>

Wasn&#8217;t chess invented like a year ago? Is this a typo or forshadowing</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Precisely when, where and from whom chess entered InnWorld has remained a bit murky.  Olesm says it is only a year old, and it is clearly a novelty when it catches the world by storm with him at the eye, but the Titans PoVs states that he played and beat an impatient disinterested King of Destruction, which already puts chess in InnWorld for at least a generation.</p>
<p>The thing is, the Blighted King had to have discovered our existence one way or another before he could summon any of us, and we have not been told how that happened.  There is no law that says these are the first Earthlings to arrive in InnWorld, and one of the original trailblazing &#8220;LitRPG&#8221; series is driven by what ultimately turns out to be the Mages Guildmasters banishment of a rival to our technological world, where he poses as a philosophy prof recruiting/kidnapping college kids to send the other way with the twin goals of 1) destroying his rival and 2) bringing HIM through the (ahem) Gate Between Worlds.  But it takes a hard left at the end of the first book and becomes a series about Americans creating guns to overthrow the Slavers Guild allied with the Wizards Guild (which, after inventing magical &#8220;dehydrated steam&#8221; that drives bullets when wetted, quickly exits before the Earthlings literal freight trains plow into them along with the slave-dealers.)</p>
<p>So, um, do not count on Erin nor any of Our Heroes being the first Earthlings in InnWorld, that is all I am saying.  That, and that it would in its turn mean far more exclusively Terrestrial things than chess (e.g. the Japanese culture evidently predominating among genetically Asian people in the Draath Archipelago) may exist in InnWorld.  I can definitely see a lot of Aeia in Mrsha (their names have the opposite problem; then again, Mrshas character is not heading in directions nor with characters that her origins make deeply disturbing.)  It makes me glad that, for all her maturity and frequent somberness, Mrsha has ret/gained her childish innocence and tenderness.</p>
<p>Joel Rosenberg was one of those authors (of whom Robert Asprin made much fun) who liked introducing each chapter with some profound quote from either actual or narrative historlcal and academic figures, and this is a good place for one he borrowed from &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; author Aldous Huxleys grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley that has stuck with me since:</p>
<p>“The chess-board is the world; the pieces are the phenomena of the universe; the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance.”</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>You do know that nearly everything you just said is a massive spoiler, right?<br />
Titan&#8217;s first appearance beyond a couple of paragraphs of him being shocked someone could beat him comes after this one. No mention of the culture in the Draath archipelago has been made either though (i think) the fairies do mention to themselves in the next chapter that she physically resembles the people from there. Masha hasn&#8217;t done anything just yet either.<br />
Also, BK summoning people doesn&#8217;t mean he has any knowledge of our world at all, in most summon Isekai the magic finds and kidnaps someone that hopefully can handle the job. The fact that he summoned a couple dozen to him and somehow also grabbed as many as hundred (who didn&#8217;t all arrive at the same time let alone same place) kind of points to him not having nearly as much control over the spell as you might wish.<br />
Hell, this could be a shield hero level summoning spell that grabs people from multiple realities. No one has bothered to talk to each other to even find out if they are all from the same Earth.</p>

Plot dump chapter, ahoy! Stormy seas ahead!<br />
Magnolia&#8217;s a great character. She toes the line between a self-centered noble manipulating those around her and &#8216;A rich [Lady] trying to save the world by herself&#8217; in a way that&#8217;s frustrating but feels like what a person in her position would do given the scale of everything she&#8217;s up against. This book (section? Chapter? Whatever 2.x is) has really focused on ramping up this huge world.</p>
<p>I also liked how you changed the intensity of the purple text to represent how forcefully Magnolia was using her skill. It&#8217;s the little things.</p>
<p>Congrats on hitting $1000 a month!</p>

<p>Magnolia mentioned playing chess since she was sixteen, but I thought it was only invented a year ago according to Olesm. Given how Ressa reacted, this may have been a lie to cover up her Skill though. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was normal—but Erin couldn’t believe Lady Magnolia had seen through her so quickly.&#8221;<br />
Does Erin really get caught off guard enough in chess that it&#8217;s normal, especially in this world?</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Yes chess was supposedly only invented a year ago, the comment about Magnolia having learnt chess at 16 was a hint of some sort&#8230; </p>
<p>Magnolia and Ress&#8217; reaction was because Magnolia slipped up and nearly revealed something she shouldn&#8217;t have, but Erin didn&#8217;t notice. </p>
<p>Because Erin didn&#8217;t press for questions we don&#8217;t know the significance of the comment. </p>
<p>Magnolia could have met someone else from our world, when she was 16 (the one person she had played now and again), or something else.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>“A Goblin Lord has emerged in the south, and if a King should rampage again, we may all fall to the youngest species before the Antinium.”</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense? A goblin king, like the ones in Rags vision. People have mentioned them several times. Goblin kings have united all the goblin tribes and waged war. So if a goblin king arises &#8220;we might fall to the youngest species&#8221; (goblins) before falling to Antinium.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Ah, &#8216;before falling to Antinium&#8217;. I thought the &#8216;before&#8217; was referring somehow to their age, meaning that Antinium are the second youngest species. Thanks for clarifying!<br />
I&#8217;d still prefer &#8216;a Goblin King&#8217; given that Kings are mentioned in a lot of different contexts this chapter (Chess, Human, King of Destruction) but it&#8217;s understandable.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>magnolia knows of chess because it was a game for nobles, or she knows it cause mr. dragon man knows of it. given that chess was invented in the 500&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very likely that chess as a game existed before our world splintered off from this world. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;m REALLY intetested in is how long the Age of Wonders lasted in this world, compared to- the past 1000 years on earth (give or take about 200 years)</p>
<p>also may i just say: i LOVE erin&#8217;s daftness, her intelligence is so so MEDIOCRE, but her wisdom is HIGH!!! IT&#8217;S GREAT TO READ, like 5 cool breezes all hitting me at once, AND I WANT HER TO GET THE OTHER ANTHIEM QUEEN (in valdfore or whatever) ON THE THRONE!!! THEN THEIR WORLD CAN HAVE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND HUMMANITY (ours) CAN HAVE MAGIC AND WE CAN BRING OUR (false) GODS TO THEIR WORLD (godless lonesome world) </p>
<p>and then all our major plot problems?<br />
poof. gone. away. the good ending is setting itself up so lovely here. so damned lovely. </p>
<p>in toe with speculation, i wonder what innkeeper level 100 will lead to? erin literally making a portal between worlds?<br />
i hope her strategy (love and peace through calm battle; ie, chess) will work better than any warriors will. i have high hopes for this story!!! i can&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;d let me down. </p>
<p>as for typos:</p>
<p>The world had gone silent, and Erin had felt the same sensation that always overtook her when she used the [Immortal Moment] skill now.<br />
shouldn&#8217;t be the word &#8220;now&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia twinkled at Erin.<br />
ok so in the context it makes sense, but maybe Erin got the the impression that she was twinkling would be better. </p>
<p>“Oh, a [Lady] has ways.<br />
has HER ways</p>
<p> I would simply love to play a game with you while we chatted.<br />
while we CHAT</p>
<p>I believe you’ve met a very striking Runner named Ryoka Griffin?<br />
you&#8217;ve is too passive for the sentence, and since Magnolia&#8217;s tact gets dismantled later, simply &#8220;you&#8221; would read gooder. </p>
<p>Erin blinked at first, but when Magnolia asked her whether she wanted to be white or black and they began playing the game, her chess instincts kicked in and she began to play, chatting as she did.<br />
should get rid of one of the &#8220;began to plays&#8221;</p>
<p>I know the other charming young men and women downstairs are from another world.<br />
no typo, i just thought this was a /perfect/ line</p>
<p>I wished to see you playing your best, and so I broke the rules most shamefully.<br />
this reads like a bad oxymoron </p>
<p>She had begun to enter the world of chess, and then she’d travelled into another world.<br />
begun to REENTER the world</p>
<p>world; I can see that for myself.”<br />
shouldn&#8217;t be a semicolon</p>
<p>And in that immortal moment, Erin realized something was wrong.<br />
OH THAT&#8217;S WHAT IMMORTAL MOMENT DOES!!! EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR STRATEGIST 10/10 WOULD SKILL AGAIN</p>
<p>She was not in control. Because as her mind weighed the choice, every part of her pointed towards her inn. Yet…something was telling her to say yes.<br />
should merge the second all three sentences into one uber long phrase</p>
<p>Your lovely rear end is in my face<br />
gay like i am</p>
<p>The girl blinked in outrage and the woman continued.<br />
&#8220;blinked&#8221; I&#8217;m gonna pull a magnolia here, and say you can do better than that verb!!! startled, scoffed, icy stare, anything but more blinking. i like pulled back in shock and disapproval, myself. </p>
<p>You have quite magnificently foiled two schemes of mine, which so rarely happens that I am in shock.<br />
two schemes of mine, which HAPPENS SO RARELY that I am in shock. </p>
<p>i&#8217;m too lazy to do the rest of the chapter, and none of these are spelling edits anyway. nice job.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for another chapter with another great character. I loved it when she dropped all pretense! And her reason for it! Ahahahah</p>
<p>Are you going to update with another stretch goal now that you&#8217;ve reached 1000k? Congrats by the way!  Or are you going to move the goal post like you did before?</p>
<p>Also, are you going to eventually go back and edit your beginning chapters? Your writing has improved an amazing amount since you started. This was especially stark with your beginning of this chapter summerizing what she did in your first chapters. I have to say her remembering was better written than the actual events had been. (I hope you take this as a compliment!) I know a lot of other web serial writers do an edit like I&#8217;ve described before publishing an ebook. Is that your plan too?</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for finding out what happens at the inn!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I guess my truer goal would be to hit $1,300 per month because with transfer and Patreon&#8217;s own 5% fee, that would be a safer income for me to have.</p>
<p>But seriously, this is incredible and you are all great. I do plan on going back and editing those first chapters, but they&#8217;re a nightmare for me since I can&#8217;t figure out how to keep that slow opening and buildup while making them less&#8230;blah.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m bad at revisions. But I&#8217;d definitely do that before releasing an e-book, which is also down the road. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s just so much to do, and still a limited number of me to do it. For now, I&#8217;m going to write ahead so I have a backlog and get that monthly side story out and then I&#8217;ll start working on extra stuff!</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I would advise you to hire a proffesional editor, and not rely on  yourself and us, the readers.<br />
i know that it&#8217;s going to be VERY expensive considering the amount of words you&#8217;ve written, but in the end I think you profit more from it in the long run.<br />
This is such a huge book, in which you obviously put A LOT of work into it, and still are going to do it (much more than you already did), and it would be quite sad to see that you don&#8217;t get nearly as much attention, praise, for it than you could have gotten, because of typos, and grammar mistakes. I&#8217;ve seen several books that didn&#8217;t hire an editor, and were heavily criticised because of it, which likely stopped many other readers from buying it.<br />
This is going to build your reputation,  and the more damaged it is the harder it is going to be for you in the future.<br />
You might save now a few thousand, but miss the opportunity to get so much more, or so I think. </p>
<p>You probably have a hard time financing a prof. editor, but it is not that you have to do it all by yourself. There are after all sites which focus on fans supporting their authors, etc. I would advise you to keep it on hold and wait for your readership to increase , as the more fans you have the more people will lessen your burden.<br />
It is likely tempting for you to release it soon, as it would offer you another way of earning money. But, it is not that you are in dire need of money. True, right now it isn&#8217;t much that you get, but you can&#8217;t ignore the fact that you earned it ridiculously fast. By the end of the year you might even double the current amount, if you post additional rewards, as you said you intend to.<br />
Try not to be too hasty—not saying that you are— otherwise you just shoot  yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>I hope that it was at least a little helpful, and I didn&#8217;t write it all for naught.</p>

So the question remains: what will do you? Will you try to save this world we live in, or wait for others to do it for you?”</p>
<p>&#8220;What will do you?&#8221; Should be &#8221; what will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoughts whirled around in Erin’s head, not least of which was that Magnolia had put enough food in the carriage to feet both her and Reynold for a week. But that wasn’t as important as what she’d learned.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8216;If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut.&#8217; &#8211; like in this scene from Kill Bill I had a slight feeling of awe in this chapter&#8230; not for the first time&#8230;<br />
On the other hand, I find it slightly unrealistic that Erin, of all people, should give a group of well equipped youngsters, that have the support of Magnolias house, all of them being probably trained athletically, like it is common in &#8216;our world&#8217; nowadays, and yes: boys, a smaller chance of survival than herself at her arrival, being alone and confused. And with the talent of faster levelling. Besides, there is the group in the Clown chapter who does exactly that. Hell, even Ryoka, though not comparable in prowess to the group, faced some of the tougher monsters alone and survived. If the boys were just couche potatoes or nerds, they wouldn&#8217;t have expressed a desire for adventuring inthe first place&#8230;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I did not find Erin&#8217;s opinion unrealistic.  Erin has nearly died several times [fish/goblins/acid flies/crab/goblin chief/shield spider/undead], had people die to protect her [klbkch/chess club], and seen adventuring parties get wiped out.  If anything, she realizes the dangers of the world and just how unprepared Joseph and company are.  </p>
<p>Even the Americas Group from the Clown chapter lost half their people on their first outing, and the ones that did survive only did so because of the soldiers that died to protect them.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Erin sees herself in them. She is wrong, yes.<br />
They are less unprepared as they seem. They are gamers. Games are simulations of reality. Just as this reality is a fantasy.<br />
And they, who are experienced in games. Not like chess, but those role playing games where they face death and danger. Obstacles and plots. They would understand most of all what the world will be like after the first taste. These heroes wont have to break down several times to get the point across. For they have gone trough countless campaigns from multiple realities and worlds. Isn&#8217;t this the nature of rpgs, yes?<br />
Them getting sabotaged by Magnolia will get them furious at the world, GET MAD, BURN THE LEMONS. *cough cough* readjust their beliefs to fit the world and make the world work for their benefit. Even if they do not discover how their DM (Magnolia) Is trying to make them fail. No doubt that they&#8217;ve experienced this prior, A DM who is just cruel.</p>
<p>They are bound to have a much easier time as magnolia wants to cripple them, not kill them. They will, get mad at the world and make it their bitch. Which will naturally Frustrate the [lady]. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s even possible that their nonchalance is an act to make magnolia reluctant to contain them. They have seen fellow worldfarers get killed. They ought know the danger. It&#8217;s improbable that they could ignore the death of fellow humans, especially as they are so few. With the lack of them respawning, it is proof that death is real as can be. They have one chance to get this campaign right. They start out well equipped, go trough some easy and safe jobs to get the feel for it. (unlike those heroes who got drafted and sent deep into danger right off the bat)<br />
 It feels like they know the need for strength. For all their talk, there is a chance that those children have untold experience with these matters. From their talk, I get the impression that they are experienced RPG players. Who else is there to become legendary heroes than those who have out of the world knowledge about the operation and taking advantage of such systems.</p>
<p>Magnolia&#8217;s just the first boss to overcome. And Erin thinks they are not killers, so they will get killed. But even tho erin too ain&#8217;t a killer, she&#8217;s good at killing things. How different are they from her? They who aspire to adventure.</p>
<p>As they are not killers yet. There is hope, yes?</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I would agree that there is hope, but I feel like you may be overstating their abilities as &#8220;gamers&#8221;. Sure you may overcome hardship/difficulties and may even have to resolve major moral/intellectual problems as a &#8220;gamer&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily the difficult part.</p>
<p>The true difficulty lies in the travelling, and actual &#8220;adventuring&#8221;. The logistics of what it means to truly be able to essentially be a roaming mercenary force. Does gaming lend to being able to locate water or food? Do they know how to light fires and keep away dangerous bugs that may give them disease? To set up camp and create shelter, keep their food safe. How would they even deal with wounds, potions are quite expensive. They would need extensive medical knowledge to deal with bleeding, infections, sickness from nature (like hypothermia), and all that crazy stuff that we don&#8217;t necessarily think about in everyday life. Or how to deal with the more supernatural stuff that monsters/ weird environments bring to the table such as burns from mean fire monsters, frostbite from ice magic/ice monsters, dealing with a malignant curse from magical items or different toxins that could easily kill. Even more simply, how will they deal with cleanliness? Not being clean enough could easily lead to death or an autoimmune issue like tapeworms. And while skills may eventually help them, surviving up to that point is quite difficult. And that&#8217;s just the physical difficulty, all this trouble sort of doubles because of all the mental exhaustion of constantly having to solve these problems</p>
<p>And if the thought that &#8220;runners don&#8217;t have to deal with these issues&#8221;, that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re constantly travelling between places that can provide for their essential needs. Unlike adventurers who have to eventually spends weeks/ months in the nature.</p>
<p>tl;dr the know how of travelling is quite difficult, and may potentially kill everyone off before they can achieve anything.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>The logistics of managing a adventuring company, the politics between groups, picking jobs, travel.</p>
<p>They are under magnolias wing, not alone. They have the funds, resources, potions, gear. They will prepare for what they expect, face the world and their misconceptions. Like how they get tired, the weight of armor, supplies. The fright of monsters. The nice company or annoying bother of other companies.</p>
<p>But they will complete the quest. And return alive. Anyhow, what are the odds that this group gets ambushed by op beast men or some other overwhelming monster? Just as the hero party and their ill prepared bodyguards did.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like an internship, they wet their feet. Get a sense of what reality is like. And learn to do it right, yes? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious. It could go any way, even off a cliff. heh~heh~heh Yet again, as it always does.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I tend to disagree with the notion that being a gamer is a bonus. If anything I would consider it a handicap. First off, just because they have played a few games isn&#8217;t going to make them better at the system that someone who grew up with said system. Secondly, games are meant to be balanced and fair, real life is neither, even a real life that includes levels. Finally, games are meant to be beaten. Games are, mostly, interactive stories. The players may not have plot armor, but they do, usually, have the ability to reload a save.  That is something they will have to unlearn, and it will not be easy nor painless.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;Not like chess, but those role playing games where they face death and danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, no, they do not; few of those people have faced death more than once or twice, if that.  The qualitative differences between that and any game are far greater than between role-playing and chess (especially since genuine role-playings depressingly low share of the RPG market has only shrunk further in the age of consoles and laptops; AD&amp;D 4th ed. is little more than a push-button video game without the video.)  For example, every piece but the kings faces death and danger each and every time the board is set up for a new game &#8212; but both players still walk away at the end, every single time:  Because they are only pretending to wage true war on each other.</p>
<p>The gamers might have a very small leg up on say, someone like Erin, who did not play those types of games much.  Yet that edge would vanish within a few weeks, if not days, as the stark raving terror of being constantly stalked by death from bandits, monsters or just evil people to powerful to be held accountable took hold.  A month in, the edge of not freezing or panicking the first time they were in a live-or-death situation would be far more valuable than knowing how to grind out levels:  Because the ones familiar with the latter but not the former did not get to restart the game with a new character&#8230; .</p>
<p>The truth is they are ALL fish out of water who need months of steady disciplined tutelage before they will be safe to wander around without a keeper (and even then the odds would be against them, because very few people can make up a native advantage of decades with just a few months study.)  The ones in Rhir had the best preparation possible &#8212; and half STILL died their first time out, even with a large body of cannon fodd &#8212; er, &#8220;escorts&#8221; drawing fire for them.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure Lady Magnolia is correct that advanced technology would make levels and classes irrelevant.  We&#8217;ve seen that you can invent new classes and skills &#8211; Erin&#8217;s [Wondrous Fare], Ryoka&#8217;s [Barefoot Runner] &#8211; so what&#8217;s stopping someone from inventing the [Gunslinger] or [Sniper] classes and doing superhuman things with guns?  Heroes with guns have their own rich set of legends to draw skills from.</p>
<p>Even limiting it to known skills, an Archer or Crossbowman could transfer a lot of their skills to guns &#8211; imagine a sniper with [Unerring Shot].  A Tactician would have no trouble making the jump &#8211; [Attack Formation] doesn&#8217;t care what weapon you use to make the attack.  A soldier with [Lesser Strength] or its upgrades could turn crew-served weapons or artillery into man-portable weapons, and wear body armor that no human could carry.  A high-level soldier armed with a gun could easily be worth a hundred normal humans with guns.</p>

<p>Artists from our world, writers, music composers, cooks, carpenters, architects. We have the sum total of human knowledge at our fingertips. The kids of our world have a much higher probability of learning the right skills to create masterpieces. Imagine an erin, but instead of being a master of chess, has mastered drawing. We have amazing animated films (a series of drawings in quick succession) Games like trine, braid, transistor that are gorgeous (and everything unmentioned). Tumblr, devianart, pixiv filled with stunning illustrations. Childrens books art books. Realistic drawings that are wondrous and breathtaking. All this without magic. To augment the height of our modern skill and achievements with [skills] and the system. The children are likely to outperform any native, just as Erin is outperforming everyone in chess without relying on any skills. Just as Ryoka is outperforming runners yet playing on the Bloody-fields-of-doom difficulty.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>You don&#8217;t even have to actually do anything to start massive changes, just talking about the things we know could result in (scientific) revolutions.<br />
Does this world know about viruses and bacteria? About how cells work? Aging?<br />
Are they aware of all the chemical elements? How to produce electricity?<br />
What about psychological disorders and their treatment?<br />
What about advanced math and physics? This is all necessary for engineering and architecture. </p>
<p>The stuff we learn in school is already more advanced than what this world knows. University teaches you a great deal of theoretical knowledge but very little of it translates to practical skill that you could apply in a fantasy world.</p>
<p>Here on Earth we rely on our technology a great deal. There&#8217;s almost no job that doesn&#8217;t involve some sort of advanced machine or computer anymore. Or complicated chemicals, medicines etc. The few jobs like butcher, carpenter and so on that you could somehow do even without electrical tools already exist in this world and the people doing them have Skills to compensate.</p>
<p>Building a gun is difficult if you have to start from scratch. Sure, with our basic knowledge we could probably build a simple cannon after a month of experiments and than it wouldn&#8217;t last for longer than maybe 3 shots and be inferior to a fireball spell.<br />
Even when you know what the end result needs to be, you can&#8217;t condense hundreds of years of continuous development into a few weeks.<br />
Just getting the right metals for a gun could take a long time, the gun powder isn&#8217;t exactly easy to make either (pure black powder wouldn&#8217;t work for a modern gun) and all the knowledge and techniques necessary to put it all together isn&#8217;t exactly common.<br />
You could probably cheat and use magic or rare magical materials for a few steps &#8230; but then the gun wouldn&#8217;t be a cheap mass-produced item anymore.</p>
<p>On one hand, our basic knowledge could jump start a scientific revolution&#8230; on the other, our specialized knowledge doesn&#8217;t really apply, for example my IT knowledge is next to useless in a world without computers and networks.<br />
That world simply lacks the infrastructure we&#8217;d need to shine.<br />
Doing martial arts as hobby is much more useful than having most modern jobs.<br />
If you look at the Heroes and other summoned people, then most picked up Classes and Skills that already existed, almost no-one created new ones based on their otherworldly background. Erin and the clown might be the only exceptions so far.</p>
<p>Being able to create stunning images in our world is vastly different from doing so in a fantasy world. Without a computer, without the internet for references, without photoshop, without modern tools&#8230; things might not turn out so well. You&#8217;d have to start at zero and that&#8217;s where everyone else is, too. Raw talent might not be enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d even go as far as saying that most modern people would simply starve if they were stranded in another world. How much of what we &#8220;know&#8221; came from a movie? How many people actually know how to fish? How to plant a seed? How to build a hut?<br />
If you take their phone away then a teenager or young adult is already in a crisis.  Now remove the amenties of modern life, and almost everyone would be struggling just to survive.<br />
I mean, it&#8217;s cool that I know how a fridge works (in theory) but that doesn&#8217;t help me at all in the wild when I try to preserve the meager food I managed to scrounge together. </p>
<p>A society based on magic might not even be interested in technology. Sure, we can do wonderous stuff now&#8230; but all of that is based on an infrastructure that doesn&#8217;t exist over there.<br />
Assuming we somehow managed to re-create our technology there, it would be extremely expensive. A car or a refrigerator would simply be curiousities for the rich, not something anyone would use. Especially not since they have magical solutions that are better and more widely available.</p>
<p>That we here on Earth can enjoy our standard of life is based mostly on our ability to mass-produce our goods. It&#8217;s only because we make everything in bulk that working class people can afford to have nice stuff.<br />
Imagine how expensive a smartphone or car would be otherwise. </p>
<p>And as I already mentioned earlier, this is true for guns, too.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>In a world where everyone has skills for producing and applying their disciplines. Where a blacksmith can use skills instead of power tools. Where artists and singers have [perfect recall].<br />
Setting up infrastructure would not be a stretch, creating basic guns and producing black powder is as simple as knowing the recipe.</p>
<p>Take away the computer from an artist, lose access to virtual paint and the undo tool. Yet they will always have paint and charcoal to fall back onto. There&#8217;s probably a [undo] skill for painters, not to mention [perfect stroke] [multi stroke].<br />
Just as where you take a cook from our time with our fancy convex ovens and whatnots. We still have the experience of creating things. Now empowered by [classes].</p>
<p>Theoretical knowledge is the backbone of all practical knowledge. Knowing how to do something right is half the coin. Applying it is the other.</p>
<p>A commentary on how the modern world is a complex system that makes luxuries cheap. We rely on each other, we rely on the infrastructure. We specialize our skills for working together to push each other onwards. The sum total of all human knowledge and progress at our fingertips. We thrive in knowledge.</p>
<p>Even as we lose power cause the specialization does not apply to the current infrastructure of the new world. Even as we would land in foreign territory. Yet we also originate from a time and world where we could learn and master any discipline, find instruction and apply it. </p>
<p>So NO. we do not start at ground ZERO. We&#8217;re far above. Taking away access to modern tools does not reduce us as human beings, it does not remove the disciplines we&#8217;ve practiced or the theory we&#8217;ve learned. If the infrastructure does not fit our skills than we&#8217;ve got to upgrade it. From simple to complex. One move at a time.</p>
<p>As for living in the wild. They&#8217;re doomed. No amount of [skills] nor [spells] will have them survive.<br />
As for living expenses. They&#8217;ll starve to death before finding a way to apply what they know.<br />
Being foreign people, no one&#8217;s going to help em either.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics is what makes *our* universe work.  There are no guarantees that the alternate world works the same way.  Indeed, since our universe doesn&#8217;t have magic, there&#8217;s no way that magic could simply be an application of QM.  Either magic has its own laws that override conventional physics, or QM simply doesn&#8217;t apply in this universe.  Either of those scenarios will leave your physicist tearing his hair out.</p>
<p>Also, quantum mechanics requires a lot of modern technology to even begin to study.  You aren&#8217;t gonna build a particle accelerator at medieval tech levels.</p>
<p>&gt;Just as Ryoka is outperforming runners yet playing on the Bloody-fields-of-doom difficulty.</p>
<p>Ryoka is outperforming Runners, but remember how she stacked up against the Couriers.  Skills aren&#8217;t merely a shortcut to becoming good at something, they allow you to go *beyond* human capabilities.  That was my point &#8211; no matter how much technology and training that an unskilled fighter like an Antinium has, a person with Skills can get the same technology, the same training, and still have the magical bonus of Skills on top of that.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Though many people brought to this world are young, are all of them 20ish? No, I suspect some humans from our world may have been older.</p>
<p>Also, in many parts of western Asia and much of Africa, there are lots of wars employing child soldiers. And the USA gun laws aren&#8217;t as restricted as other first world countries, and even that varies by state; though it is unlikely for most American citizens to carry a gun at all times, many do carry concealed weapons for protection.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>That is a real chapter for thought. Magnolia seems more and more like Taravangian from the Stormlight Archive novels. Well-intentioned, but seemingly amoral. Willing to commit great crimes in theory to save them all. Perhaps not the best way to go about it, but she&#8217;s trying. Having just read the Antinium war chapters, I would suspect she got this way after having bonked a few too many heads together when trying to warn everyone the first time.</p>
<p>This raises some interesting questions:</p>
<p>Are the Antinium really the enemy? Is the summoner of Ryoka, Erin, etc. good or bad?<br />
Is Magnolia actually being honest? This seems like a person with concentric plots.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Most modern people know most of those things; it beggars belief that InnWorld does not have enough modern people for them to put it all together eventually:  They remain astride the shoulders of giants despite leaving behind the giants themselves.  You know what is in gunpowder as well as I (the trick is the proportions, but not THAT big a trick for any who already know them.)  Magnolia just mentioned MAGNETS (not lodestones) in this very conversation; strap one to a wheel inside a coil of wire and you have a generator (or at least dynamo,) and steam engines are older than Rome:  They just had very little use in a slave-owning society almost wholly ignorant of electricity (the Greeks noticed enough to name electrons after amber, but that was about it.)  </p>
<p>The Prime Directive can never be salvaged, because no one can un-learn the knowledge that compromised it (unless you are willing to slaughter everyone who knows the secret before they can tell anyone else, as Magnolia probably is if it comes to that, but I doubt even she could pull it off even if so inclined.)  &#8220;You can&#8217;t un-ring a bell.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Magnolia should know better.  Stability doesn&#8217;t come from lack of weapons, it comes from balance of power.  The fact that the introduction of modern weapons would potentially shift that balance in favour of the Antinium is a problem that she has correctly identified.  But as long as they were introduced to all the other places at roughly the same rate the balance would remain the same.  It would change the way battles were fought, just like it did in our world.  (Suddenly knights were no longer invulnerable juggernauts, so tactics had to change.)  If anything it would be less traumatic on their world since their tacticians and strategists would automatically know how to use and defend against the new weapons most effectively, so there wouldn&#8217;t be nearly so much mass slaughter due to generals insisting on fighting in idiotic ways because &#8220;that&#8217;s the way we&#8217;ve always done it!&#8221;</p>
<p>It likely wouldn&#8217;t actually change much with the Antinium either, so long as the weapons were introduced on both sides.  Antinium don&#8217;t generally level much, they rely on optimized body design for combat and numbers.  So you give both sides guns and what happens?  The Antinium have a large army, so they have a high expense for manufacturing the weapons and ammunition to equip them&#8230; </p>
<p>And they&#8217;re all about as good at marksmanship as the average [Farmer] of the other races.  Maybe slightly better depending on which side gets more practice, but no levels or classes means it&#8217;s just down to repetition.  </p>
<p>What has that actually done?  Well previously a human [Farmer] was no match for even a single Antinium warrior.  Now he is if he&#8217;s properly armed.  So the Antinium desire to purge non-Antinium form the world just got more difficult.  Plus the armies of the other races do still level.  Any shooting related skills and classes would likely work just as well with the new weapons, so the armies of the other races would still outclass the Antinium with only a small amount of reprioritizing to focus more heavily on ranged fighters than melee.  But after that it would go down about like the Battle of New Orleans.  Expert riflemen on the American side who could reliably hit targets at 600+ yards facing off against a much larger number of less-well-trained riflemen on the British side who could only reliably hit their targets at 200-300 yards.  British casualties:  several hundred.  American casualties: fewer than fifty.</p>
<p>As the tech level increases more, warfare becomes more a matter of industrial production capacity than anything else.  The Antinium are good at building things, but they don&#8217;t have the raw creativity or the numbers to out produce everyone else since they don&#8217;t level much and so get no significant boosts to production skills.</p>
<p>So yeah, the major concern would be the Antinium getting advanced weapons *first*.  Followed by the major nations not getting them at roughly the same time (and starting a war that would weaken the defences against the Antinium by too much.)</p>
<p>Of course, if she can find someone who knows anything significant about biology or chemistry there are lots of chemical or biological weapon options that would be quite likely to be fatal to Antinium but harmless to Humans, Drakes, and Gnolls&#8230;  </p>
<p>Speaking of monstrous weapons of genocidal destruction that shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to fall into the wrong hands&#8230;  I wonder what Magnolia would do with something like that&#8230;</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Honestly, I would consider the major danger to be the fact that militaries would be gaining new weapons faster than society can adjust. We lost about 50 million people in the bloodiest single war because of technology advancing at a natural pace. Now imagine if instead of engineers and inventors blundering along and gradually improving on handgonnes and blunderbusses somebody hits the jackpot and finds some soldier or NRA nut from Earth who knows how to make an AK 47. You could end up with a war equally bloody with a population of only a few hundred million. If technology evolves naturally or leaks slowly enough, it would allow public opinion to turn against war in equal measure. Maybe not a goal with a good chance of succeeding, but Magnolia has no reason not to try and she has at least a few percent chance of saving countless lives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do agree with you about the Antinium. Guns might make it easier to train someone to basic military effectiveness and raise the value of what basic military effectiveness means, but it doesn&#8217;t negate the value of skills or Skills. Heck, given that Classes and Skills are cultural in nature, it&#8217;s entirely possible that they would become stronger in turn. Iron might be the standard for imperviousness now, but I would expect that if you introduced modern technology that high-level [Riflemen] would start popping up and gaining [Kevlar Skin], with the result that they would retain the same level of relative power as they have now. Heck, there&#8217;s even the chance that a high enough overall tech level would yield [Mad Scientists], and they would be uniquely dangerous and irreproducible to the Antinium.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>And than there is Reinhart saying. Please? Guns? pff they&#8217;re pointless. We have classes that are going to destroy any gunner. Guns are like parlor tricks, they wont change much of anything. Fancy tools. And than [Riflemen] show up. An objectively superior adventuring class to most.</p>
<p>As for tehnology developing really fast, the chaos is also useful for destroying traditions that harm it&#8217;s progress and implementation. Most beliefs people, including myself, are wrong, Not based in reality. Science and technology allow rapid change and if it&#8217;s a fight between tradition vs new techniques and ideologies. The second should win, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the new tools allowing for more destruction than there currently is. I&#8217;d say unbalancing the field now would reduce the casualties overall. The bloodfields are too bloody</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>This is the real problem afflicting people like Magnolia &#8212; and soon to afflict those like Tyrion Veltras even more:  &#8220;God made men; Col. Colt made them equal.&#8221;  All things considered, I imagine the author is also familiar with that quote (since The Engineer cites it in either &#8220;The Heir Apparent&#8221; or The Warrior Lives.&#8221;)  And I believe you are right that Magnolia is missing the big picture in that if guns &#8220;level&#8221; the playing field for non-leveling Soldiers facing Epic Level champions, they also level the playing field for 0th Level humans (or 27th level Gnoll [Potters]) facing Soldiers genetically engineered for mass killing.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m glad to finally have a semi-conclusive answer to the question of whether Magnolia is good or evil. Not that it isn&#8217;t another question entirely whether she&#8217;s misguided enough to bring ruin anyway, of course. And I don&#8217;t want to entirely trust someone who could quite possibly use her Skills to simulate reasonableness and logic when she&#8217;s spouting nonsense. We&#8217;ve already seen that forcing through a mind control spell doesn&#8217;t automatically protect someone from further manipulations when Ryoka broke through the spell making her find the necromancer without restoring her edited memories.</p>

<p>Later in the story when you describe how a technology that already exists in this world was simply made a bit more common, and the severe impact that had&#8230; it was amazing writing.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>First, thanks Aba for the story!  It&#8217;s entertaining and very generous of you to offer it up free of charge.   I also appreciate some of the realism.  Just because it&#8217;s a fantasy world doesn&#8217;t mean that characters shouldn&#8217;t still act consistently with their motivations.  Ryoka, Magnolia, and Khrsh(sp?) Bring good examples of that.  </p>
<p>I do (of course, sorry!) Have one complaint though&#8230;. Erin.  If I had to choose a term to describe her, it would be obnoxiously stupid.   She&#8217;s not unintelligent.  That would be forgivable.  I&#8217;m fact, her success with chess suggests that she&#8217;s actually HIGHLY intelligent.  At least in some ways.  The trouble is that she apparently chooses to turn her brain (but not her mouth) off when it comes to anything but chess.  It was nice to see another character call her out on it.  And I&#8217;m not even going to suggest that it&#8217;s unrealistic.  I&#8217;m sure there are people like her out there.  But it makes certain passages tough to read.  Especially since chess, arguably, is all about consequences.  And Erin willfully ignores these in seemingly every situation that doesn&#8217;t involve chess pieces.  I appreciate Magnolia.  But I think her biggest potential contribution to the story would be to have Ressa continue to follow Erin around giving her immediate &#8230;&#8221;feedback&#8221; for her non-stop idiocy.</p>
