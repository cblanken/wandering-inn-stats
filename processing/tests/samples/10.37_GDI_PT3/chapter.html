<p><span style="color: #800000;">(Hey everyone, I’m taking my very-delayed yearly break until May 10th! Time to rest, recharge, and read a story myself. –pirateaba)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">{This chapter was released in three parts. Be sure you started with Pt. 1! –pirateaba}</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrsha jerked out of her bed and nearly went tumbling to the floor. It was her room; she put a hand to her pounding chest and realized bare seconds had passed since she’d fallen asleep.</p>
<p>She—she sat up, feeling at her thin body. It was still her body. Root Mrsha’s body that was—but it was <em>her.</em> New Mrsha?</p>
<p>Mrsha, the one and only! Accept no substitutes like Future Mrsha! She felt confident of that. The Skills were still echoing through her head as she took stock of them.</p>
<p><em>Well, well, well. That wasn’t bad. No [Other Me’s Skills], though.</em> Fair enough. It had been sort of way too powerful for her. Fitting for a girl who’d leapt through reality—but she was half that girl now.</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Mrsha got up and realized that Nanette wasn’t in her bed. No wonder; Mrsha would have tossed and turned and woken her roommate up. The girl tottered to her feet and belatedly wished she’d haggled with the Grand Design for a voice. Not because she <em>needed</em> one, but sometimes she just wanted to <em>shout</em>.</p>
<p>I’m alive! Alive! The girl raised her paws and screamed silently at the roof. Then her breath caught as she remembered all the people trapped in another reality. All the suffering. All the death.</p>
<p>That was all her responsibility, of course. Just doubled. Mrsha stood there on her bed, feeling each beat of her heart as precious. She clutched at her chest, closed her eyes, and knew in that moment there was only one thing that mattered. Before anything else…</p>
<p>She went to see her mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>——</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, the day continued, and tears continued to fall, but it was not always, forever, unending misery. There was always a spark in the darkness, so that the darkness could be, or a shadow under the brightest sun, hidden by every smile.</p>
<p>It was not over. No, in fact; the world had just begun to change, and there would be consequences. There always were from the very moment everything had begun. Echoing outwards.</p>
<p>People levelling and dying, sometimes coming back to life, just as Isthekenous intended. But his body was resting now. The God of Designs had long since passed, and his creation worked on.</p>
<p>There would be more aftereffects, continuations, but as the day dawned, a little girl lay in the [World’s Eye Theatre]. Not the [Garden of Sanctuary].</p>
<p>Mind you, she was not, de facto, <em>alone. </em>No one trusted her to be on her own right now. Lyonette didn’t stare at her every moment, but there were multiple people, staff, [Knights], and so on watching her.</p>
<p>From afar. Ready to leap into action if…just if.</p>
<p>Of course, it was when they lowered their guards the moment would come when she’d slip out of sight. It was after all this had faded from recent memory they’d break from their vigilant watch, and the [Princess] knew it. So she was making plans, but in truth, the girl wasn’t doing anything at the moment, and she had no intention of causing more trouble.</p>
<p>Mrsha lay on her back, staring at the sunlight falling through the crystal domed ceiling, warming her fur. It was sunlight from somewhere else in Izril; rain was still pouring down over the Floodplains. But she asked for a sunlit sky and just lay there. Eyes open, lazily turning every now and then, having snacks that were brought to her so she’d regain weight.</p>
<p>Not doing anything. Visibly, that was. They were all watching her, from Nanette to Bird, to see what she might do after all this, but Mrsha, genuinely, wasn’t plotting anything. Even the Grand Design checked a few times, but she meant it.</p>
<p>She wasn’t silly enough to say ‘no more adventures’ or ‘no more Mrsha moments’ forever. She just hoped she’d stop with that. The girl’s open eyes focused on nothing in front of her, and she wasn’t sleeping.</p>
<p>She was daydreaming, rather. Her mind imagining worlds and events that were less real than the [Palace of Fates]—or so she hoped. Being a Grand Design to the thoughts inside her head.</p>
<p>What was she daydreaming of? Well…Mrsha closed her eyes for a moment and imagined a little girl wandering through the [Palace of Fates], opening doors. In her mind, the [Palace of Fates] was beautiful again, not damaged or destroyed, and the girl was…her.</p>
<p>Her, but a bit more clever. A bit wiser, a bit more thought in her head, and she opened door after door. Searching for a solution for the Titan.</p>
<p>Surely there was one. Surely…</p>
<p>Mrsha turned and smelled Calescent baking fresh spicy bread. <em>What if she had asked for Zel first? The lonely Tidebreaker would be so unhappy—then someone else.</em></p>
<p>Queen Marquin? Yes. Or Sheta.</p>
<p>Mrsha imagined the Empress of Harpies flying down upon the horrid Titan and declaiming about her new Empires of Iltanus, and wondered if it could have been…better.</p>
<p>What if the world of the Beach Inn had just come into The Wandering Inn, bringing chaos and silliness and…the other Erin? It would hurt. But she imagined that moment when Lyonette screamed and cried and the other Erin developed a gleam in her eyes and had a plan to combat the Titan, running into Pallass and throwing them into uproar.</p>
<p>Or what if there hadn’t been chaos in the future? What if they had entered the Goblin King’s world and—and found a way to stop him? The girl dreamed of it, putting together fate and mistakes in her mind, imagining a world in which the many worlds did not vanish and crumble and the peoples within got the happy ending they had deserved.</p>
<p>Tears glimmered, unshed, at the corners of her eyes as she stared up at the light shining down from above, and she dreamed of that strange world of crossroads. Then she closed her eyes and began again.</p>
<p>For a moment, imagining what might have been.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>So, here we are. Four months past my projected deadline, and many, many words done, and the arc is over.</p>
<p>This isn’t the epilogue. I lied. It’s the ‘epilogue’ of the [Palace of Fates] arc in the sense that it’s a chapter with a lot of the resolution, but I never meant that as the end of Volume 10.</p>
<p>Nor is it an epilogue in the sense of everyone going off into the sunset. Tomorrow occurs, and it’s real and present. This is the concluding chapter that continues the journey—but it is a marker.</p>
<p>I’m taking my month off after this. I’m past the due date, and I wanted to take it at the start of the year—everything past that has been overtime work, and I have felt myself burning lower with each week, despite the necessary breaks and time I took to myself.</p>
<p>This was the final push. Now, I think, I can rest and take the month off, where I would have otherwise been bothered by leaving the arc midway through. But it was a journey near the end, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Not just for me. For readers. I know some readers didn’t like the arc from the start, and that’s too bad. Whether it was the content, the genre, or any number of reasons, it is too bad if someone found nothing to love in the chapters—but it’s also hard even if you enjoyed it.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories in manga form is 3-Gatsu no Lion, a story about someone who plays shogi. I don’t understand shogi, but it’s not just about shogi, but so much more. It is one of the best stories I’ve ever read—another story is One Piece, which I picked up as a kid and is one of the longest stories to this day.</p>
<p>It sucks, waiting for the next chapter, week after week, year after year. I know how hard mangaka, artists in Japan, work. If I burn out on writing, they work themselves to the bone and beyond. And yet, as the reader, I’m left hanging on beautiful chapters of artwork which I devour in minutes and then re-read, impatient for more.</p>
<p>When the story is done, the reader can experience it as a whole, and so I think people who arrive now will get to read the [Palace of Fates] arc and have a better experience than those who had to wait, week after week, with delays, for each chapter.</p>
<p>Which begs the question: is there a benefit to being the reader who’s caught up? Not in the sense of being able to read the story as a whole. Not for patience, certainly. What does a reader who waits for George R.R. Martin’s next book get, if it ever arrives?</p>
<p>The walk, I suppose, with the story as it grows and hopefully thrives. The right to say, ‘I was there’, because that does mean something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I’m being philosophical, but I think I get to before my break and after this arc. This isn’t the post-mortem I want to do. That is for later, when readers have read through this as a whole, after the dust settles and time passes.</p>
<p>The break. I think for a week or two my mind will just collapse on itself and I’ll be a vegetable. Other writers I talk to know what that’s like; you don’t do anything, you unload the mental energy and exist.</p>
<p>Active vacations aren’t what you do if you want to actually recharge. Exciting vacations are a lot of mental strain, so I think I’ll just collapse like a pile of lemons and, hopefully, rally by the end of the month and be reading and consuming stories. That’s important.</p>
<p>But mostly? I’m going to get my physical done because I’ve been putting off my visit. I need to get my teeth checked and cleaned. I was gonna check on my ears, but I had that stupid ringing problem, so I got that out of the way.</p>
<p>I’ve put off all kinds of stuff aside to work because I just didn’t have the bandwidth to work on it. The most pressing thing is…my glasses. I wear glasses, a pirateaba fact I feel comfortable sharing with you after 8+ years of us knowing each other.</p>
<p>I realized on my trip to Vancouver I was having a tough time staring at distant objects, but I didn’t really think of it. Then I was told, recently, that you should get your prescriptions checked fairly regularly. Every few years. When I think about it…</p>
<p>I think…</p>
<p>My glasses, as they are, are older than The Wandering Inn. I haven’t had the prescriptions changed in at least eight years. Which I <em>admit</em> sounds bad, but it’s one of those things you don’t think of. Until my glasses get scratched up, I don’t worry, or I don’t think about things in the distance because I’m usually typing on a screen. (And my glasses have been in great condition because I use the glasses cloth instead of a shirt.)</p>
<p>New glasses. It’s not glamorous, but it’s important, and it makes me feel better just thinking about seeing more clearly. That’s all I want to do during my break.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I took a long time on this arc. Not as long as I could have. But longer than any other big arc. I think there’s still one last phase of writing where I write all this, months of effort, then I stop, wait for eight months, and come back and do a <em>second</em> pass.</p>
<p>That’s huge, too much for the web serial where I want chapters to come out, but it could be done. If the story needs it, rewrite it all. Redesign important parts. Do a third pass.</p>
<p>…But that’s not this story. I don’t want to keep you waiting that long, and we’ve come this far while changing the formula slightly, but trying to tell a story you can at least walk with, instead of waiting years or months at a time to follow after.</p>
<p>One month. One month so I can find new stuff to inspire me and rest, and I’ll be back to it. I hope you found something to like in this arc and that the next chapters excite you. I have so many I want to still write, all over that crazy world. But I want to tell them right, so for now, I’ll be resting.</p>
<p>And getting new eyes. Thanks for reading,</p>

<p><strong>PS. </strong>For the art on this chapter, we have a submission from one of our [Artists], Yura, who created an entire <em>video</em> based on the [Palace of Fates] arc. I won’t give anything away except to say that I consider it an amazing work that I had to feature here.</p>
<p>A story about The Wandering Inn I didn’t know by heart gives me such delight. Please give her huge applause, and all the other artists who’d made amazing art based on this chapter of The Wandering Inn.</p>
