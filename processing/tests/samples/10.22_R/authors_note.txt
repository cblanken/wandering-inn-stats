Author’s Note:
There’s a quote that I’ve always remembered from a Peanuts book I read once. I think it’s from Charles M. Schulz, the creator. But I could be wrong, or misremembering it, or it could even be another character. If so, I apologize, and I couldn’t find the wording online. But here’s what I remember.
‘When I have a bad day, it rains on poor Charlie Brown’. It was about how the creator put their emotions into their work. I remember reading it as a child, and wondering what Charlie Brown had ever done to deserve that.
As a writer, I get it, even if I still disagree with the wording. You can write when you’re upset, angry, or to process something. What emerges is not necessarily the emotion that went in. I have written myself out of bad days, or into dark moods. Writing is not something that you can do dry and impartial, at least, I don’t. So I get why good old Charles looks up and sees overcast skies, sometimes.
This morning, I just received word my grandmother has passed away. It was not a shock, but today isn’t a day I’ll be writing The Wandering Inn, I think. I won’t go into details, but she passed away peacefully, I hope, and she had a rich and vibrant life. A stroke changed the final years of her life, as it does, but I remember a very vividly kind, compassionate, and headstrong grandmother.
I am absolutely sure I could write a chapter of The Wandering Inn. And perhaps it wouldn’t be special. Or perhaps it would be something wondrous, or dark. But I don’t think it’s wise. Or perhaps I just don’t want to.
So, things have changed. It’s not the kind of news that will send me flying off tomorrow, but I will likely need to be making plans and going places in this already potentially busy month. If I have unexpected breaks, or I miss an update, that’s why, and I apologize in advance.
As fate would have it, I do have some small advantages. I wrote two smaller chapters already, so I have a backlog in case I’m out of it writing or writing-mentality wise for a bit. But the writing may be jeopardized for a bit.
I’m not, right now, emotionally that sad. Because I knew what was coming, and it is not sudden, but I am by no means in a regular state of mind. I am, I think, as people write, a bit empty, and emotions may come in time. Distracted, might be the word. Looking around and reminding myself someone’s going to be gone forever. That’s selfish. I wish her the best on the next adventure, and I am allowed to be personally whatever.
So I’m not going to necessarily be writing more chapters of The Wandering Inn, but I may keep trying to write. Writing is good. It’s a distraction, my job, and it’s how I process things. But perhaps I’ll step back. I could write a chapter, right now, putting everything inside me that I know and don’t know into a chapter.
…But Erin is not Charlie Brown. She has been where I am before, so many more times, and I am fortunate to have known so few friends and family who passed away. So.
A long time ago, years, now, I thought of the day my grandparents or family members passed. As a writer does, because I think of everything. There is no way to process something that has not yet occurred, but even thinking of the future on those days when I stood outside with an umbrella in the middle of a storm—I did the only thing I could.
I created my own character, who, like Charlie Brown, was meant for days when it rains. I’ll be taking time, perhaps a bit, before going back to The Wandering Inn, to write a story I saved for today. The name of the story is:
Griefman.
Thanks, and write or call your family sometimes. If they deserve it. My grandparents have all been the most wonderful of people.
