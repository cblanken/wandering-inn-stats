Author’s Note:
I took a day off to edit this one and the next part. So it’s not ‘every day a chapter’. I’m also not posting on Wednesday because I need days off.
But I have a plan. I have been executing on the plan. Whether the plan is good or not or was flawed from the start, we shall see. Perhaps we shall all hear a ‘slam’ in time. But I hope it is now clear what is going on to some extent.
These chapters shall continue. I think they are appropriately sized, and they do benefit from editing. If I were smart, I’d have backlog and be posting them and be able to edit well in advance, but I’m never that organized.
Just wish me luck. Writing should be something you can do a bit of each day, not a frantic life-or-death struggle of stress and fighting to a finish line. So often it’s the latter for me, because I want it to matter.
…But I could enjoy chill writing too. The beach chapters were some of my favorites in recent memory to write. We’ll see how the, uh, stress levels work on these next few. I don’t know how the readers feel. See you on Thursday!
