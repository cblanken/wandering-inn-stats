<p>“<em>When you meet a truly ancient Dragon, count and parcel out each word. Waste no time, for each single syllable matters. Their memories stretch back to the dawn of this world, and their answers reveal the truth, so speak to them like a poet, with all the grace and authority and wisdom you can muster. When you get them talking, pour a cup of tea, because then they won’t shut up.</em>”</p>
<p><em>—Empress Sheta, the Empire of Harpies, 2174.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Events were in motion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>——</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marching an army north past the Bloodfields took time. Getting them into position without alerting anyone? Extraordinarily difficult. But it could be done; Drakes had ‘safe routes’ into the High Passes they had charted just for this event. At some point, all would be revealed, so they had agents on the ground. The most dangerous part of a Goblin tribe was a Chieftain. Remove her from the equation and it got easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>——</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They’re running. They’re <em>running!</em> Clear the highways! They’re on the move, and I’ve never seen them go this fast!”</p>
<p>“Stop screaming and sit <em>down. </em>You are a Courier, Hawk. Not an incontinent Street Runner. Where are they?”</p>
<p>Mihaela Godfrey barked as the Rabbit Beastkin shouted into the scrying orb. She ripped a map from the unconcerned Drakes and began issuing orders.</p>
<p>“<em>Send out an emergency message. Lock down every single road south of them. </em>The Kraken Eaters have caught City Runners and even Couriers on the march.”</p>
<p>“Where are they even going? Their territory’s in the north. They’ve left the coastline, and they’re moving fast.”</p>
<p>Mihaela traced a straight line south and grunted. If you took a ruler and moved it across half the continent…you’d have to be an idiot or a bird to plot your course like that. But she held her tongue on that as she responded to the Drake Guildmaster of Marwsh’s Runner’s Guild.</p>
<p>“Too early to call. But if I’m right…somewhere stupid. Put the alert out. Oh, and find that idiot Persua. Tell her she’s going north immediately. She’s on Emergency Runner duty for anything needed in the path of the Kraken Eater tribe.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>——</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It hurt a lot when you hit the ground. Mrsha had experience.</p>
<p>When she woke up…she had no idea where she was. Only that her normal days had suddenly come to an end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Writing Note:</strong></p>
<p>I may have to do the box chapter soon. And maybe the Liscor election one. Break up this ongoing arc with it? It is past-time for that. Let alone the Horns, Erin, Nerin, Oteslia, New Lands…</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I write notes to myself like the above. Normally, it’s not like that, it’s something in all caps in one of my notes documents, saying ‘don’t forget’ and listing a plot point.</p>
<p>I have so many viewpoints and places to be, and you know what? That’s fine. It’s a good thing for stories like this. I’d rather have too much to tell, than not enough. The key is that each arc should be riveting and cause riots when we step away from it.</p>
<p>An author should sometimes be a professional who knows how the story is going to end, who can write an essay about the thematic and structural elements of each character, story beat, and chapter, and who has enough dictionary words to win any scrabble game ever.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the author should also be coming up with new plot points as they write, revising in the middle of the night, burning the midnight oil with messy hair (if they have any), and frothing at the mouth and about to die, but still typing.</p>
<p>Both are very real ends of the writing spectrum, and a good writer should be able to do both. I probably fall on the latter end more often, but I do know…the bones of this arc.</p>
<p>We may have passed out of Goblin Days into something else. But I may also continue the naming appellation and one-chapter-per day theme.</p>
<p>I don’t know. What I do know is that I am going to <em><strong>not post anything till next Saturday. </strong></em>Why?</p>
<p>Because I’m tired. I’m out of my backlog, and I’m tired. Even with coffee, my body hurts. I’m tensed up, and I have been told I’ve passed 80,000 words in these seven chapters. So I wrote 10,000 words each day.</p>
<p>The short chapter thing, uh, didn’t work. But the momentum sure did. I liked this, and I want to keep refining the art. One more chapter on Saturday for Patreon readers. Also, I am looking forwards to that monthly break, but that’ll be a bit later…wish me luck on the last chapter.</p>
<p>You’re going to want it too.</p>
