<div class="entry-content">
<p>This was a tale about Saliss of Lights, not Onieva Oliwing. It was about a Drake who didn’t sleep well.</p>
<p>You’d think that wouldn’t be a problem for a Named-rank adventurer used to venturing into the wilds of the world and fighting, sometimes for days on end, without sleep. Saliss had done that. Of course, the ‘wilds’ of the world used to be few and far between.</p>
<p>Now that the New Lands had opened up, walking into Medain’s magical dungeons with a pickaxe, nude after being tricked out of all your clothing, without any [Mercenaries] or adventurers to back you up, a lone [Apprentice Alchemist] with a grudge—</p>
<p>Well, it just wasn’t as cool as the kids these days. Not Archmage. Saliss of Lights had every expectation that by the time the dust settled, there would be a new crop of Named-ranks with stories to tell that blew the old guard out of the water.</p>
<p>It was like Archmages. He’d pantsed two in his lifetime so far. Or if they had robes, underpantsed them.</p>
<p>Criminal, really. The fact that he could even lay his claws on them. If the stories about Zelkyr back in the day were true, Saliss should have been hunted to death across the continent by <em>three</em> Truestone Golems over the matter rather than just had to dodge a few [Lightning Bolts].</p>
<p>The Drake’s mind was wandering. He absently added some red dust to a film of liquid that had an ocre quality to it already, trying to parse where the dust settled on the already-vibrant mixture.</p>
<p><em>Close. Close…</em>if the liquid within turned orange, he had to instantly let the dust break the oxygen-formed barrier and nullify the reaction about to occur. Then the mixture would turn purple.</p>
<p>If it <em>kept</em> getting brighter, it was a sign he had added too little of the red dust that suppressed the internal combustion effect and that the vial was about to explode.</p>
<p>Now, this much liquid—he had only a tablespoon’s worth—wouldn’t be as dangerous as you thought, not <em>really.</em> Oh, it had about enough force to blow a hole through the side of a regular person’s face if the charge was angled right, but normally, Saliss could probably take the hit without even dodging and be fine.</p>
<p>The <em>problem</em> was that this wasn’t ordinary stuff. A tiny—and by tiny, Saliss meant ‘measured in Fraerling units’—piece of white seith was mixed into the ampule of liquid.</p>
<p>It had sped up the catalyst effect, and he added more of the red suppression dust made of a spore from the Bloodfields, ironically enough.</p>
<p>Saliss estimated that if he got this primer liquid right, then, after he added all the regular enhancements to the alchemy vial, akin to someone piling up wood and kindling to enhance a [Fireball] spell—</p>
<p>“<em>…Potion go boom big.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>This is a reminder of two things to you. One—why I had to announce I’m moving down to 30,000 words.</p>
<p>Doing two chapters doesn’t work. I thought to myself, ‘pirateaba’, because I think in the third person, ‘pirateaba, you’ve got to do a short chapter because  you’re too tired to do the third Erin chapter justice’.</p>
<p>So I planned out a 10,000, maybe 15,000 word chapter about Saliss on Saturday, after posting the last one. Did a pretty decent outline, then started the next day to write it in one go. Edited Wednesday.</p>
<p>24,000 words.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Writing this many words does drain my energy battery considerably. Hopefully with a day off, I’ll rally enough come Thursday to do the Erin chapter justice but this is why. This is why.</p>
<p>Anyways, the other lesson is that you can’t just sit on your thumbs and wait to well, write a chapter like this. There’s a good quote about hesitation. About waiting for the ‘right moment’ and compromising until then.</p>
<p>I choose to apply it to arcs that aren’t easy, or fun for me to write. They have to happen, and I cannot wait until I am in the right mood or have all my ducks in a row because they never will be. It is imperfect; I was editing the last…five hours which is why this chapter is out later than usual. But even if imperfect, we forge ahead.</p>
<p>Or sometimes, we take a break! Next month. I do think I’m willing to push harder this month because of my vacation and the reduced workload next month. Did I mention going on a vacation to a country? Do I tell people what country? Eh, you’ll never find me in Puerto Rico. I hear it’s nice.</p>
<p>Wait, am I going to that country or another one? I’d better check my tickets. (A few were being floated around, okay? I have tickets. I just don’t actually know which one it is.)</p>
<p>That’s all from me! I’m tired. I wonder if anyone reads The Wandering Inn, in Puerto Rico. I wonder what’s for dinner. I wonder how I’m going to finish this Author’s Note.</p>
