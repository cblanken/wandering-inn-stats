<p>They were once a group of Named-rank Adventurers, an internationally recognized team named World’s Founding. As the late Archmage Tritosech wrote in an analysis of the team at the time, their name was almost as pretentious as the core members themselves. But World’s Founding had kept the title, because how else would you describe a multi-species team with the only Fraerling adventurer in the world and one of the few Beastkin adventurers ever to hit Named-rank?</p>
<p>They had been the <em>largest</em> adventuring team of their time. Second only to famous groups like Balsame’s Legion, notable for having hundreds of adventurers in days of yore. World’s Founding had been political.</p>
<p>They had entered into conflicts between nations and altered the course of wars, deflecting a Terandrian incursion war in their first famous battle against another nation. Then—taking a visible stance against Jungle Tails, one of the four Great Companies of Baleros, seeking to gain even more power.</p>
<p>The entire story of Niers Astoragon was famous enough for multiple tales, from his involvement with other characters like the King of Destruction to the Lightning Thief’s adventures. The highlights everyone knew were how his company started:</p>
<p>The World’s Founding team had been cornered along with an army of disorganized forces from every species on Baleros by Jungle Tails’ army. World’s Founding vanished after two months of protracted, deadly hunting and were declared dead after they failed to resurface for months.</p>
<p>Then, the mysterious army that would become known as the Forgotten Wing company emerged from the Labyrinth of Souls, a Named-rank dungeon, and began to win battle after battle. Six adventurers, including Niers Astoragon and Foliana, began earning their reputations.</p>
<p>World’s Founding vanished in that dungeon. The group of dozens of adventurers, from Silver to Named-rank, and an army of disparate soldiers were reduced to six surviving adventurers and four hundred veterans.</p>
<p>When asked, the few survivors of that mysterious point in history seldom spoke of what they had seen or done; the Labyrinth of Souls was later claimed by the Forgotten Wing company and sealed. No other team ever reached the dungeon’s heart, despite two Named-rank teams entering.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, a retiring Selphid [Vanguard] made comments to an aspiring [Author] seeking an alternate take on the retelling of the Forgotten Wing company’s rise to glory. The book sold eighty-eight copies and was not remarked on. Among other aspects during the interview, the Selphid refused to mention specific details of what they’d seen in the dungeon but provided the [Author] with a few quotes. The passage read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Niers Astoragon kept us alive down there. It was Jungle Tails behind us or the dungeon ahead. Parts of the army were pursuing us—that’s what no one ever mentions, I suppose. We were exploring the dungeon because they were slaughtering us from the rear. Ahead or behind. Death either way. So yes, that tiny little [Strategist] was the one who pushed until we reached the final point in the Labyrinth of Souls. He saved us.”</p>
<p>At this point, our intrepid investigator pauses for a sip of tea, and I keep my voice level, not letting an inflection of disappointment into my tone as I reply, “So it seems. Which squares entirely with established accounts. Why would this be so controversial?”</p>
<p>Jaucton sits with his new Human body in good repose, smoking on a puffer as he weighs his next words like a Minotaur laboriously lifting a slab of stone. The silence is palpable before he replies.</p>
<p>“Well, because he saved us. And killed us. We could have surrendered, and some of us would have made it. I doubt World’s Founding would have; Jungle Tails wanted their heads. He drove us until we saw the end. A brilliant [Strategist]; that’s what he was even back then. A lot younger, and he swore more back then, but they were all sort of like that. Foliana was always sneaking up on people and scaring the shit out of [Soldiers]—sometimes as we took a shit. But it’s the ones you don’t think of, you know? Melsaiid the Draconid. Anyone remember him? Haspeta Springwalker? Named-ranks. Even when we ran into Old Ones…Niers was right there and just pointed straight ahead. We could have fled.”</p>
<p>Then, Jaucton pauses, dear readers, and I see his Selphid body flinch within his form, and he clamps his lips shut as if he’s said something too much. Instantly, I press him about this ‘Old One’, a hefty claim, but he refuses to speak on the dungeon. All he will say, after nearly twenty minutes of silence or shaking of his head, is this:</p>
<p>“If we’d surrendered or fled, maybe the Forgotten Wing company wouldn’t have been made, and it’s to be named a Great Company any day now, I hear. Maybe it’s bigger than all of us, and he’s the Titan of Baleros. He did it, that’s all I wanted to say. We could have run away, and Jungle Tails would still be in power, and nothing would have changed. But we didn’t.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book never reached popular acclaim, possibly due to the [Author]’s insistence upon styling themself after the famous Krsysl Wordsmith’s by inserting himself as a protagonist into even objective historical accounts.</p>
<p>Despite this, the account was one of the few honest interviews ever put to public word about any other survivor’s feelings on the Forgotten Wing’s dark period of history.</p>
<p>The moral of the story was probably that Krsysl Wordsmith negatively influenced an entire generation of [Historians] by discrediting their style and the class in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>It took Paxere all day to get back home, and Vultapheles was so tired they didn’t even lecture Paxere on the deal or convene a meeting of the Lucifen; they just went to rest.</p>
<p>She, herself, was feeling energized by what had been done but refused to gossip as Lucifen and nosy Agelum located her and demanded to know what had happened. Paxere felt…different.</p>
<p>Every now and then, she’d turn her head and look back southwest, across the ocean, at a being she now knew to be alive.</p>
<p>Whom she was linked to, for better or worse. No—better.</p>
<p>Paxere shook her head as she felt the odd…soul, a well of power, in her chest. A piece of her.</p>
<p>More than that, as if it were a color, influencing part of Paxere as well. Power. Authority. And a connection. Perhaps not the earthshaking power Paxere had hoped for. Maybe it was the bargain’s nature or just Paxere being younger.</p>
<p>But she felt like she would be able to access more powers of the Lucifen and share the power…if not the soul. A success all around. Except—Paxere paused.</p>
<p>“So. She’s mortal after all.”</p>
<p>Erin was indeed mortal. Paxere couldn’t read Erin’s mind, but some emotions, yes. And what the Lucifen had found, to her surprise, was one emotion above all else in Erin. Buried deep, defining the woman.</p>
<p>Rage. So much of it that it was scorching even to the Lucifen. Erin Solstice was filled with a burning fury that was righteous, vengeful, petty, and more from the core of her soul. Who knew the [Innkeeper] was like that? Well…Paxere turned. And wondered what Erin Solstice felt.</p>
<p>She wondered what the [Innkeeper] would do next.</p>

<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>I am tired. And you know what? A beta-reader just reminded me that I wrote, for this chapter, 37,000 words over two days. And I went ‘oh yeah, that’s a lot of work even by my standards’.</p>
<p>Hello, I’m pirateaba, and I have a problem. The problem isn’t my audience or my job, though.</p>
<p>Strange. Only one update has passed since my announcement about writing less come April, but it seems like a week or two has passed, for me. I can’t say why.</p>
<p>The response has been tremendously amazing. Thank you all for being so supportive, and I think it’s the perspective that’s made things feel so different.</p>
<p>Here’s my example: for this chapter, I worked hard. I was pulling out tea and coffee for the first part of this chapter, despite having kicked the caffeine habit and ordering sushi for motivation. I was struggling. I got it done, and I think I actually had some good moments while writing, but I had a moment there, when I said ‘huh’.</p>
<p>This is a lot of work. I slowed down and went, ‘wow, I do this every week? How long have I been doing that…?’</p>
<p>Eight years if I’d kept it up till August, I think. Of course, the word count increased substantively later on, but the point is I’ve done this amount for years. People have been telling me to slow down, to take more breaks, that I’m working too hard, from editors to readers to everyone else.</p>
<p>But I was in the thick of it, believing I had to keep putting out the same output, so I didn’t let myself notice how intense it was. Now I’m allowed to relax, I think it’s hitting me harder.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the interesting part (this should probably be a blog post but I’m too tired to make a separate post):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing about this is unique. In fact, this lesson I’m describing is probably one of the most mundane and universal takes every person, online and off, will relate or learn at some point in their lives. Most people will come to this realization, I think, especially in some jobs and parts of our culture.</p>
<p>If anything, the lesson is in how mundane and universal this realization I came to is. I have already been told and observed the things I’m now telling you I figured out. Yet I didn’t <em>understand</em> it until this very moment, if that makes sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps, if anything, it shows how what we take for granted or ‘know’ can turn out to be different than what we expect. The sense of reality, of what we believe, is different from the truth.</p>
<p>It’s like reaching out to touch something that doesn’t exist, or, if you want to go to a negative example, being told something and finding out it’s different—the definition of gaslighting. Yet the ability to question what we hold as a truth or reality or see things from another angle is important.</p>
<p>We must look for these things…but I digress. Sorry, I’m being philosophical. And grateful. I am going to keep up the momentum this month, though I cannot deliver a third Erin chapter in a row next update.</p>
<p>I’ll have 1 day to write, and one to revise, so it’s an interlude for me. Not sure which one I’ll do. There are plenty. But I do think I want to get back to this arc by Saturday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, for this extended Author’s Note, I would once again like to remind you dear readers supporting me and everything I say implicitly of why I hate J.R.R Tolkien. A monster who has disserviced writers by being one of the most annoyingly skilled polymaths who translated Norse myths, helped write the Oxford English Dictionary, survived a war, and could write songs, poetry, and <em>another stupid language.</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to match the breadth of his worldbuilding. For instance, I didn’t even know that the Elvish, the language he made, as well as other languages like Klingon, are actually defined as ‘conlangs’, or constructed languages.</p>
<p>That’s apparently a thing. And it’s hard work and a pain in the ass to even imagine writing one of them. I barely remember what a preposition is—I skipped through one of my English years in High School and, I swear, that was the year they taught all the grammar terminology (or I just didn’t ever pay attention).</p>
<p>Doing a conlang might be impossible even if I was on my easier time schedule. Which is why I ask for help because I’m not JRR Tolkein. Or Shakespeare, as one of my readers (Litwickee, it’s Litwickee of the typo squad), keeps reminding me.</p>
<p>I still can’t do the translation that well even with all my notes and the translation examples, but hey. You can translate all kinds of stuff with this handy example sheet I have. I’ll show it to you later, but I’ve got to get the grammar stuff right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s all from me. Small things, boring chapters, and sushi. Tempura sushi. I don’t think I want any with crab meat or shrimp. They’re bugs. I didn’t like sushi for years, actually; refused to even touch the stuff. Now I have an appreciation for it. Things change.</p>
<p>I refuse to eat shrimp. See you next chapter!</p>
