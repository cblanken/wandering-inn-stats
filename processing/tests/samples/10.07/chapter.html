<p>They were once a group of Named-rank Adventurers, an internationally recognized team named World’s Founding. As the late Archmage Tritosech wrote in an analysis of the team at the time, their name was almost as pretentious as the core members themselves. But World’s Founding had kept the title, because how else would you describe a multi-species team with the only Fraerling adventurer in the world and one of the few Beastkin adventurers ever to hit Named-rank?</p>
<p>They had been the <em>largest</em> adventuring team of their time. Second only to famous groups like Balsame’s Legion, notable for having hundreds of adventurers in days of yore. World’s Founding had been political.</p>
<p>They had entered into conflicts between nations and altered the course of wars, deflecting a Terandrian incursion war in their first famous battle against another nation. Then—taking a visible stance against Jungle Tails, one of the four Great Companies of Baleros, seeking to gain even more power.</p>
<p>The entire story of Niers Astoragon was famous enough for multiple tales, from his involvement with other characters like the King of Destruction to the Lightning Thief’s adventures. The highlights everyone knew were how his company started:</p>
<p>The World’s Founding team had been cornered along with an army of disorganized forces from every species on Baleros by Jungle Tails’ army. World’s Founding vanished after two months of protracted, deadly hunting and were declared dead after they failed to resurface for months.</p>
<p>Then, the mysterious army that would become known as the Forgotten Wing company emerged from the Labyrinth of Souls, a Named-rank dungeon, and began to win battle after battle. Six adventurers, including Niers Astoragon and Foliana, began earning their reputations.</p>
<p>World’s Founding vanished in that dungeon. The group of dozens of adventurers, from Silver to Named-rank, and an army of disparate soldiers were reduced to six surviving adventurers and four hundred veterans.</p>
<p>When asked, the few survivors of that mysterious point in history seldom spoke of what they had seen or done; the Labyrinth of Souls was later claimed by the Forgotten Wing company and sealed. No other team ever reached the dungeon’s heart, despite two Named-rank teams entering.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, a retiring Selphid [Vanguard] made comments to an aspiring [Author] seeking an alternate take on the retelling of the Forgotten Wing company’s rise to glory. The book sold eighty-eight copies and was not remarked on. Among other aspects during the interview, the Selphid refused to mention specific details of what they’d seen in the dungeon but provided the [Author] with a few quotes. The passage read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Niers Astoragon kept us alive down there. It was Jungle Tails behind us or the dungeon ahead. Parts of the army were pursuing us—that’s what no one ever mentions, I suppose. We were exploring the dungeon because they were slaughtering us from the rear. Ahead or behind. Death either way. So yes, that tiny little [Strategist] was the one who pushed until we reached the final point in the Labyrinth of Souls. He saved us.”</p>
<p>At this point, our intrepid investigator pauses for a sip of tea, and I keep my voice level, not letting an inflection of disappointment into my tone as I reply, “So it seems. Which squares entirely with established accounts. Why would this be so controversial?”</p>
<p>Jaucton sits with his new Human body in good repose, smoking on a puffer as he weighs his next words like a Minotaur laboriously lifting a slab of stone. The silence is palpable before he replies.</p>
<p>“Well, because he saved us. And killed us. We could have surrendered, and some of us would have made it. I doubt World’s Founding would have; Jungle Tails wanted their heads. He drove us until we saw the end. A brilliant [Strategist]; that’s what he was even back then. A lot younger, and he swore more back then, but they were all sort of like that. Foliana was always sneaking up on people and scaring the shit out of [Soldiers]—sometimes as we took a shit. But it’s the ones you don’t think of, you know? Melsaiid the Draconid. Anyone remember him? Haspeta Springwalker? Named-ranks. Even when we ran into Old Ones…Niers was right there and just pointed straight ahead. We could have fled.”</p>
<p>Then, Jaucton pauses, dear readers, and I see his Selphid body flinch within his form, and he clamps his lips shut as if he’s said something too much. Instantly, I press him about this ‘Old One’, a hefty claim, but he refuses to speak on the dungeon. All he will say, after nearly twenty minutes of silence or shaking of his head, is this:</p>
<p>“If we’d surrendered or fled, maybe the Forgotten Wing company wouldn’t have been made, and it’s to be named a Great Company any day now, I hear. Maybe it’s bigger than all of us, and he’s the Titan of Baleros. He did it, that’s all I wanted to say. We could have run away, and Jungle Tails would still be in power, and nothing would have changed. But we didn’t.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book never reached popular acclaim, possibly due to the [Author]’s insistence upon styling themself after the famous Krsysl Wordsmith’s by inserting himself as a protagonist into even objective historical accounts.</p>
<p>Despite this, the account was one of the few honest interviews ever put to public word about any other survivor’s feelings on the Forgotten Wing’s dark period of history.</p>
<p>The moral of the story was probably that Krsysl Wordsmith negatively influenced an entire generation of [Historians] by discrediting their style and the class in the eyes of the world.</p>
