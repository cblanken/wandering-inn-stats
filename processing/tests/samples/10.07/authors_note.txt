Author’s Note:
I am tired. And you know what? A beta-reader just reminded me that I wrote, for this chapter, 37,000 words over two days. And I went ‘oh yeah, that’s a lot of work even by my standards’.
Hello, I’m pirateaba, and I have a problem. The problem isn’t my audience or my job, though.
Strange. Only one update has passed since my announcement about writing less come April, but it seems like a week or two has passed, for me. I can’t say why.
The response has been tremendously amazing. Thank you all for being so supportive, and I think it’s the perspective that’s made things feel so different.
Here’s my example: for this chapter, I worked hard. I was pulling out tea and coffee for the first part of this chapter, despite having kicked the caffeine habit and ordering sushi for motivation. I was struggling. I got it done, and I think I actually had some good moments while writing, but I had a moment there, when I said ‘huh’.
This is a lot of work. I slowed down and went, ‘wow, I do this every week? How long have I been doing that…?’
Eight years if I’d kept it up till August, I think. Of course, the word count increased substantively later on, but the point is I’ve done this amount for years. People have been telling me to slow down, to take more breaks, that I’m working too hard, from editors to readers to everyone else.
But I was in the thick of it, believing I had to keep putting out the same output, so I didn’t let myself notice how intense it was. Now I’m allowed to relax, I think it’s hitting me harder.
Now, here’s the interesting part (this should probably be a blog post but I’m too tired to make a separate post):
Nothing about this is unique. In fact, this lesson I’m describing is probably one of the most mundane and universal takes every person, online and off, will relate or learn at some point in their lives. Most people will come to this realization, I think, especially in some jobs and parts of our culture.
If anything, the lesson is in how mundane and universal this realization I came to is. I have already been told and observed the things I’m now telling you I figured out. Yet I didn’t understand it until this very moment, if that makes sense.
Perhaps, if anything, it shows how what we take for granted or ‘know’ can turn out to be different than what we expect. The sense of reality, of what we believe, is different from the truth.
It’s like reaching out to touch something that doesn’t exist, or, if you want to go to a negative example, being told something and finding out it’s different—the definition of gaslighting. Yet the ability to question what we hold as a truth or reality or see things from another angle is important.
We must look for these things…but I digress. Sorry, I’m being philosophical. And grateful. I am going to keep up the momentum this month, though I cannot deliver a third Erin chapter in a row next update.
I’ll have 1 day to write, and one to revise, so it’s an interlude for me. Not sure which one I’ll do. There are plenty. But I do think I want to get back to this arc by Saturday.
Lastly, for this extended Author’s Note, I would once again like to remind you dear readers supporting me and everything I say implicitly of why I hate J.R.R Tolkien. A monster who has disserviced writers by being one of the most annoyingly skilled polymaths who translated Norse myths, helped write the Oxford English Dictionary, survived a war, and could write songs, poetry, and another stupid language.
It’s hard to match the breadth of his worldbuilding. For instance, I didn’t even know that the Elvish, the language he made, as well as other languages like Klingon, are actually defined as ‘conlangs’, or constructed languages.
That’s apparently a thing. And it’s hard work and a pain in the ass to even imagine writing one of them. I barely remember what a preposition is—I skipped through one of my English years in High School and, I swear, that was the year they taught all the grammar terminology (or I just didn’t ever pay attention).
Doing a conlang might be impossible even if I was on my easier time schedule. Which is why I ask for help because I’m not JRR Tolkein. Or Shakespeare, as one of my readers (Litwickee, it’s Litwickee of the typo squad), keeps reminding me.
I still can’t do the translation that well even with all my notes and the translation examples, but hey. You can translate all kinds of stuff with this handy example sheet I have. I’ll show it to you later, but I’ve got to get the grammar stuff right.
That’s all from me. Small things, boring chapters, and sushi. Tempura sushi. I don’t think I want any with crab meat or shrimp. They’re bugs. I didn’t like sushi for years, actually; refused to even touch the stuff. Now I have an appreciation for it. Things change.
I refuse to eat shrimp. See you next chapter!
